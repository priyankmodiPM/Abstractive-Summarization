five staff members left the royal easter show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride down ' the super slide ' at the sydney royal easter show .
it is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery .
