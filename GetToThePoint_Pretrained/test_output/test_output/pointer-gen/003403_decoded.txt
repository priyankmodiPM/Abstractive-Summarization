former animal shelter worker catherine lynn smith , 50 , was arrested tuesday after the bodies of 10 cats and three cats were found decaying in her home .
the 50-year-old 's home on north pine knoll drive was recently auctioned off , and new homeowner ed harrell was checking out the property in the afternoon when he found a dead dog just inside the doorway .
the animals ' bodies were apparently so decayed that it was impossible to conduct a necropsy to see how they died .
