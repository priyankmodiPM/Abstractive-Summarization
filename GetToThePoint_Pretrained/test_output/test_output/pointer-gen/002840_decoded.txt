nicola bonn , 34 , started a candid blog called upfront mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl poppy , 14 months , and many of her posts have gone viral .
she wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldnâ€™t feel as ' clueless ' as she did .
one of her blog posts , why we need to stop justifying ourselves , went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby .
