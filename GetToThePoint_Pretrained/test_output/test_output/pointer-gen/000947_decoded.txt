the main highway that heads east out of kathmandu shows massive cracks , the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturday 's huge tremor .
one lane is bisected by gaping , half-meter ( 1.5 feet ) fissures .
they 've been filled in with rubble and dirt , allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts .
