keats , a san francisco writer and self-described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist , has designed a ' millennium camera ' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus .
the camera , which is made of cooper and allows light to enter through a tiny hole and change paint inside , will create one image that keats says will display centuries of changes to the environment .
