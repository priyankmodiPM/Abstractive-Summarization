muhammad naviede , 60 , was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying : ' i 'm in a plane out of control and it 's going down ' .
the 60-year-old , whose daughter is a former x-factor contestant , sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on august 20 last year .
the experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the aaib said would require ' considerable dexterity ' .
