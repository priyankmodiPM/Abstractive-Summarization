lord janner , right with cake , took michael jackson - who was repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court - on tour of parliament in 2002 .
she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating establishment cover-ups by deciding that labour peer lord janner should not be charged .
