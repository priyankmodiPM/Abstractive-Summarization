the thief scaled a two-storey antique market before breaking into a rooftop vent and squeezing down a narrow shaft to reach the store .
he picked three sets of locks and crawled on the floor ‘ like a snake’ to avoid triggering infrared security beams .
the man and an accomplice returned the following night to try to smash through the reinforced vent and alerted police .
