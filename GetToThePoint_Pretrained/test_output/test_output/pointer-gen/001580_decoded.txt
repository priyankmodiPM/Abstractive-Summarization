patricia wilnecker , 81 , fell in love with lamorna cove in cornwall in 1948 .
she has gone there every year - but can no longer go after a run-in with the landowner 's son .
miss wilnecker claimed her exit was blocked by daniel for about ten minutes , while repair work was carried out on the private road leading to it .
mr stevenson said he banned her after accusing her of aggressively revving her engine before driving into his son .
