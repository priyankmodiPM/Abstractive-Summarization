jason lee , 38 , faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old irish woman in the hamptons in august 2013 .
the rape ended when the girl kneed him in the groin and staggered out in such a ‘hysterical’ state she was unable to talk .
lee tried to downplay the incident and said it was ' no big deal ' and dismissively told the first police officer on the scene : ' we 're good , you can go ' , the court heard .
lee was a high flying executive at goldman sachs who lives in manhattan .
