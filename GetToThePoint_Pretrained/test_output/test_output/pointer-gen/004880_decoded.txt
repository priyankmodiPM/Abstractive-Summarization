rugby school is known as the spiritual home of the game , with the world cup trophy named the webb ellis cup in honour of the schoolboy called william who made the daring decision to disregard the rules in 1823 .
today the school is still steeped in the traditions of the sport , alongside its own rich history of ' muscular christianity ' .
