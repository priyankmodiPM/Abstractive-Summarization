caleb benn , a californian high school student , has developed a $ 4.99 ( Â£3.24 ) app for ios devices using instagram 's application program interface .
called ' uploader for instagram ' , it allows users to upload photos to instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone .
the email asked benn to ' fix ' the app by monday , but benn said doing this would make the app would be pointless .
