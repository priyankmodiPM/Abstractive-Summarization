a guard at the u.s. census bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in suitland , maryland , a suburb of washington , d.c .
the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into d.c. that ended when officers shot him on a busy northeast washington street .
now police believe the suspect , only described as a man in his 30s or 40s , may even be tied to another shooting that occurred thursday .
