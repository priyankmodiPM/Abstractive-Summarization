the plane was carrying 59 passengers and eight crew members , tilted to one side and its left engine scraped along the runway .
the crew ordered an evacuation after the boeing 737-800 came to a stop , and passengers slid down the planeâ€™s inflatable slides to safety .
the incident occurred as flight 9w2423 arrived at the airport in khajuraho , about 375 miles south-east of delhi in the state of madhya pradesh .
