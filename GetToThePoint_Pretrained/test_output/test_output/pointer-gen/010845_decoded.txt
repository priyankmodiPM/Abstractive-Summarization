dmitri kovtun , who is wanted for the dissident 's murder , insisted that he was not involved in mr litvinenko 's death and suggested that he had poisoned himself without knowing it .
the suspect , a former kgb agent , has agreed to give evidence at the inquiry into litvinenko 's death as long as he is given the right to examine secret evidence put forward by the police .
if kovtun testifies , he will have to do so by video link , because he will be arrested on suspicion of murder if he tries to travel to britain .
