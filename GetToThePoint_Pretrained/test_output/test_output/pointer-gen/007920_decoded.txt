prime minister was giving a campaign speech in south london when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named west ham instead of the west midlands giants .
mr cameron this morning claimed he became a villa fan after watching the team beat bayern munich in the european cup final as a child – but admitted he could not say what year the match took place or who scored the winner .
mr cameron likened himself to the green party leader natalie bennett , who infamously blamed a ' brain fade ' .
