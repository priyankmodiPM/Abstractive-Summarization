christopher stefanoni , 50 , says his nine-year-old son demoted in the local little league to punish him for threatening the town 's overwhelmingly white ethnic makeup .
the town and the little league both deny that the goings-on of the little league and stefanoni 's housing plans are linked .
in court documents they describe his grievance as ' an imaginary slight that has no connection to reality ' .
