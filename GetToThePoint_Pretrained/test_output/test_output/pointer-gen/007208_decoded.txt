the kabul-based woman was only 16-years-old when she fell pregnant with the child of her depraved attacker asadullah - who is also married to her cousin .
even though a rape led to her pregnancy , gulnaz 's brothers insisted she would not be allowed to return to her ' shamed ' family as she was unmarried and a kabul court sentenced her to two years in prison for ' adultery by force ' .
gulnaz said that her decision to marry the rapist was purely based on the fact her daughter could live a normal life in the afghan capital without a father .
