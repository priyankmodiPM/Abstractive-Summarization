jeremy trentelman , 36 , built a giant box fort for his three-year-old son max and two-year-old daughter story , that included trap doors and a slide .
the father , who works as a florist arranging intricate displays , was greeted with a letter from code enforcement city officials one day later saying that his creation must be scrapped .
trentelman was only planning on leaving the fort in his yard for a few days , but now has decided to leave it up for the maximum two weeks before he receives a $ 125 fine .
