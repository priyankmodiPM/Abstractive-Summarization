hannah moore , 20 , of broxburn in west lothian , posted pictures of her post-pregnancy stretchmarks on instagram to inspire others .
but only two minutes later , the mum of twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate ' nudity and violence ' .
hannah says the blocking of her account has made her think her body is ' clearly fat , ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick ' .
