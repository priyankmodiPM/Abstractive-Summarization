researchers subjected lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe changes in their internal structure .
copper inside melted , indicating temperatures of at least 1,085°c ( 1,985°f ) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent .
the footage is the first time the failure of li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded .
