wayne rooney believes manchester united team-mate marouane fellaini has gone from old trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in europe .
fellaini was one of the stars of united 's manchester derby demolition of neighbours city on sunday .
fellaini was signed from everton by van gaal 's predecessor david moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player .
