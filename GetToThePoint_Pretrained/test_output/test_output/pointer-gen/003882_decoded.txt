investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan saturday evening at the arcadia palms on east sahara avenue .
two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out .
police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental , and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child .
