lebron james says he would pick himself for mvp if he could when a new set of nba awards are presented this summer .
players are able to vote in the end-of-season awards for the first time with titles such as ' man of the year ' being handed out , but while they may not be able to vote for themselves , james seems to think his influence with the cavaliers deserves recognition .
james scored 21 points with nine rebounds and eight assists for the cavs in their 104-99 victory against the bucks .
