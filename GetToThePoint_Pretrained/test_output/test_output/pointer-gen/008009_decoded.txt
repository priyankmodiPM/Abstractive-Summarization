former missouri auditor tom schweich had talked for years of taking his life - and had become increasingly agitated over politics - but left no suicide note when he fatally shot himself .
police in the st. louis suburb of clayton said they have found nothing to suggest the death of schweich , who was running as a republican candidate for governor in 2016 , was anything other than a suicide .
