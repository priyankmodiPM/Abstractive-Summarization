two trainee obstetricians have been removed from a newly developed $ 2 million hospital in western australia .
the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty .
the hospital went on ' baby bypass ' when the maternity unit opened four months ago , due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth .
