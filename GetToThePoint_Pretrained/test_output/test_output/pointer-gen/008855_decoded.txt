kim richards stormed out of an interview with dr phil mcgraw after her arrest last week .
richards apparently snubbed dr phil 's offer of help as eyewitnesses in the hallway heard her scream 'f*** ' , and other obscenities when she ran out of the room and down the hall .
richards , 50 , was arrested last week and charged with public intoxication , trespassing , resisting an officer and battery on a police officer .
