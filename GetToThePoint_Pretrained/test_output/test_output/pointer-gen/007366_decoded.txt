alannah hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin .
the fashion designer was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanoma and if she had waited another three months the cancer would have spread and become terminal but thankfully she has a ' very good ' prognosis .
hill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh and then after about a week doctors will decide if she needs anymore treatment .
