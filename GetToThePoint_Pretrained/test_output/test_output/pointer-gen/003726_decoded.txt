justin bettman built an elaborate indoor set on a brooklyn sidewalk for a man to propose to his girlfriend on valentine 's day .
bettman , sometimes with the help of designer gozde eker , would build sets that , in pictures , looked like the inside of a living room , child 's bedroom , or a bathroom complete with a clawfoot tub .
bettman 's work caught the attention of jose luis , who saw a feature on the photographer in new york magazine .
