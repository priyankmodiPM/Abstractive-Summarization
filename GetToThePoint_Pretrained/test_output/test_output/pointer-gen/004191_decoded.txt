george takei led an east coast auction house to cancel a sale of 450 photos and artifacts from world war ii internment camps .
the items from the collection of ' dean of american crafts ' allen eaton were slated for public auction on friday .
the collection includes 63 photos of people of japanese descent who were imprisoned over fears they were spies and dozens of arts and crafts they made .
the auction was halted thanks , in part , to the efforts of takei who lived in an internment camps in arkansas as a child .
