the pittsburgh steelers ended last season without le'veon bell and it seems they 'll start the new one without their stud running back too .
bell will miss the first three games for abusing the league 's substance abuse policy and he will also be fined a game cheque .
bell was stopped in his chevrolet camaro last august after a police officer noticed a strong smell of marijuana .
