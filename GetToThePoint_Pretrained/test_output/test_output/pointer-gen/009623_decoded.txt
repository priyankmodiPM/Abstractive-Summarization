tottenham defender ben davies will allow no room for sentiment up against wales team-mate sam vokes at burnley on sunday .
spurs head to turf moor looking to sustain a decent run following just one defeat .
davies maintains there can be no quarter given should he get the chance of a first spurs appearance since the 2-1 win at qpr .
