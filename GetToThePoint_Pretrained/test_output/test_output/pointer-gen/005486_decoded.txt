mario valencia took a rifle from a walmart in tuscon , arizona on february 19 .
he was able to start firing it as soon as he left , something that should have been impossible due to the gun locks are required on all weapons .
police were even told the gun was locked by employees at the store as they pursued valencia , but just seconds later he began firing into the air .
