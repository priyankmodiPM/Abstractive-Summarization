seaworld has released an almost five-year-old video depicting ex-trainer john hargrove using the n-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend .
in the five-minute video , hargrove discusses an incident in which five black men allegedly threw a rock at the woman speaking on the other line that she said hit the back of her head .
hargrove , who also featured in the cnn documentary blackfish , says seaworld is mounting a smear campaign against him in an attempt to distract from his message .
