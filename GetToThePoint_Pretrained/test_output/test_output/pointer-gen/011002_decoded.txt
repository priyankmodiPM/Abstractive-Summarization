manchester united manager louis van gaal has praised the resurrection of marouane fellaini as the big belgian prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his old trafford career 12 months ago .
on march 25 , fellaini was jeered by both city and united fans as he was substituted in a 3-0 united defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him , david moyes .
united have won five league games in a row and are in third place , a point ahead of city for sunday 's derby .
