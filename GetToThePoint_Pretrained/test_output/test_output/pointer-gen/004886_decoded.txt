melbourne-based jon czerniecki positioned trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents ' farm .
when he checked the nine hours of footage , mr czerniecki stumbled upon the upsetting spectacle , which shows the canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back .
mr czerniecki has since contacted the local council and parks victoria in hopes of notifying the owners of the dogs about what they had done .
