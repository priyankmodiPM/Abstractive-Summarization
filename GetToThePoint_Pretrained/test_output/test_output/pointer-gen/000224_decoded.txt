australia has recalled its ambassador to indonesia for consultations after two australians were executed by firing squad early wednesday .
australian prime minister tony abbott called the executions `` cruel and unnecessary '' because both men , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , had been `` fully rehabilitated '' during a decade in prison .
abbott did n't say what permanent actions , but i 'm sure the relationship will be restored .
