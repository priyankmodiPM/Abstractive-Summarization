real madrid have appealed against the yellow card shown to cristiano ronaldo for diving in the penalty area during their 2-0 win over rayo vallecano .
ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned by referee mario melero lopez after he was chopped down by antonio amaya inside the box .
the decision means ronaldo could be suspended for the game against eibar in la liga on saturday .
