the tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the river mersey in stockport .
but following the outbreak of the second world war , the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of lancashire and cheshire could hide from nazi bombs .
the cliffs were first dug out to provide cellars for homes along chestergate , one of the busiest streets in stockport .
