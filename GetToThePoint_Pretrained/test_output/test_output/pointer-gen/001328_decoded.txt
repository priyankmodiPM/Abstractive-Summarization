new haven superior court judge thomas o'keefe jr. ruled monday that lishan wang should be sent to connecticut hospital for treatment .
in a court report submitted last month , mental health experts said wang displayed ' paranoid thinking ' and was ' guarded and suspicious ' when discussing a relationship with court-appointed lawyers .
wang , a father of three , is charged with murder in the shooting of dr. vajinder toor , 34 , and shooting but missing toor 's then-pregnant wife outside the couple 's branford , connecticut , home in april 2010 .
