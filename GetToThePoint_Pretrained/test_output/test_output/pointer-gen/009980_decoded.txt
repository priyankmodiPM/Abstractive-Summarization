tim sherwood will welcome gary gardner back into his first team squad during pre-season to assess closely whether the 22-year-old can cut it for aston villa in the premier league .
gardner has enjoyed a successful loan spell at nottingham forest and scored a superb free-kick in front of the villa manager during the defeat to watford at the city ground .
sherwood is keen to see gardner , a former england under-21 player , train day-to-day before making up his mind .
