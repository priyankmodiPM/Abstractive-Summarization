sockeye salmon , native to alaska , migrate up rivers during the spring in order to reach the breeding grounds where they were born in order to spawn .
the fish , which spend the rest of the year out in the ocean , will swim against the current in order to reach the spawning grounds , leaping through waterfalls , which is where the bears wait .
