the southern poverty law center in february filed a lawsuit against georgia department of corrections officials on behalf of ashley diamond , a transgender woman .
the lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for diamond 's gender dysphoria , a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity .
department of corrections spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan wrote in an email that the agency does n't comment on pending litigation .
