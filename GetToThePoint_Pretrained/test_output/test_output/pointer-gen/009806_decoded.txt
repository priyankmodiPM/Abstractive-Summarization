remmie , 18 , had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion .
but when the piercing became inflamed , remmie was forced to remove the bar - and the resulting wound healed into a hazelnut-sized lump known as a keloid scar .
mr vijh immediately diagnosed a keloid scar , which affects between 10 and 15 per cent of wounds .
