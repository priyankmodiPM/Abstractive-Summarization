archbishop of brisbane phillip aspinall joined local catholic priest in calling for queensland 's controversial ' gay panic ' homicide defence to be scrapped .
the defence means a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter if the defendant establishes their victim ' came on ' to them , and the killing was in self-defence .
dr aspinall also appealed to those who resorted to violence at recent anti-islam rallies .
