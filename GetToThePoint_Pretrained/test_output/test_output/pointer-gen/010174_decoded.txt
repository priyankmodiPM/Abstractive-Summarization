abi gordon-cody , 26 , from droitwich , worcestershire , works as a special effects make-up artist with the daily challenge of trying to find ways of slicing off fingers and impaling bodies in a completely pain-free way .
her instagram posts of severed fingers , rotting flesh and impaled limbs may seem like the work of an extremely violent ( or extremely clumsy ) person but abi 's injuries are , in fact , all a clever illusion .
abi 's gory recreations of wounds have earned her a loyal following of almost 3000 on instagram .
