the united states began secretly tracking phones before the events of 9/11 or passage of the patriot act .
in 1992 , a drug enforcement agency operation which has since been discontinued , monitored every telephone call made from the united states to one of the up to 116 countries .
this is now the oldest known example of the american government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country .
