a man who died in texas of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in britain , a cdc report has revealed .
the man , who died from variant creutzfeldt-jakob ( vcjd ) disease in may 2014 , was a naturalized u.s. citizen originally from the middle east .
the extreme rarity of the disease , especially in the united states , led the man who was in his 40s -- to be misdiagnosed with psychiatric symptoms before ultimately receiving the vcjd death sentence .
