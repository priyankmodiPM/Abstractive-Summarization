scott suggs , 28 , and brandy kangas , 36 , were arrested after police received an anonymous tip regarding the welfare of their children .
they discovered the youngsters locked in a ' sparsely furnished ' room , where they had seemingly ' remained at all times ' .
on monday , suggs and kangas pleaded guilty to three counts of felony child neglect in relation to their children , who consequently lack social skills and are fearful of closed doors .
