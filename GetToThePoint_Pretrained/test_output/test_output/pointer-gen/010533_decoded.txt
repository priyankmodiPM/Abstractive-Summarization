south korea 's kim sei-young spectacularly eagled the par-five 18th to surge into a two-shot lead in the second round of the ana inspiration on friday .
the 22-year-old kim , who won her maiden lpga tour title at the pure silk-bahamas lpga classic in february , struck a superb second shot to six feet on her final hole .
that left the korean at seven-under 137 in the first women 's major of the season , two ahead of overnight leader morgan pressel .
