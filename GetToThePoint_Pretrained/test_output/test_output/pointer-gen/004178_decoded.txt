managers from the london ambulance service , the largest in the nhs , have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from sydney and melbourne .
they were recruited on the back of a series of practical demonstrations on dummies , a written exam and an interview that lasted in all between four and six hours .
the ambulance service is also severely understaffed and , across england , around 1,250 posts are unfilled â€“ a tenth of what is needed .
