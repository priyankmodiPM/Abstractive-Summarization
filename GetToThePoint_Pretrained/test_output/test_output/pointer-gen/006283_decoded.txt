mark halsey has slammed the decision to put jon moss in charge of the fa cup final instead of mark clattenburg .
halsey said the english game would be a ‘ laughing stock’ over the decision to ignore clattenburg .
halsey thinks clattenburg , who has never refereed an fa cup final , has been overlooked as the professional game officials board ( pgmo ) would prefer martin atkinson to go to euro 2016 next summer .
