claudetteia love , a senior and one of the top students at carroll high in monroe , said she was planning on going to the prom without a date and with a group of friends .
though a petition was started and signed by members of the senior class to allow love to wear a tuxedo , it was not acted on by school faculty .
the decision is part of the school 's dress code and not anything personal , principal patrick taylor said .
