arsenal legend paul merson admitted he was wrong to criticise the england call up for andros townsend .
it was the perfect riposte after merson said in his sky sports column : ' if andros townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody ' .
townsend later tweeted to his 285,000 followers : ' how can you tell me that a manager goes and watches man united against tottenham ' .
