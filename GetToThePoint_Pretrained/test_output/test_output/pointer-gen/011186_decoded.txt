tamara pacskowska pretended to be 76-year-old georgina bagnall-oakley at meetings with estate agents and solicitors in november .
the 56-year-old could not speak english and took her daughter-in-law monika brzezinska , 34 , along with her on the visits to help her translate .
the fraudsters were eventually caught out in a solicitors office while they were on the cusp of completing the sale of the house to fellow conman , 26-year-old benjamin khoury .
