ravi beefnah , 34 , parked his white audi a5 with slogans and parked it outside the dealership he bought it from because it uses a litre of oil every time he fills it up .
two months later and mr beefnah 's protest is still there , with the owner claiming that audi failed to resolve his long-running complaint about the engine and fix the car .
the unhappy driver says he parked his car there as warning to other drivers considering buying an audi .
