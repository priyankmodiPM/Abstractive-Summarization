michelle carter , 18 , looked glum as she appeared in court in new bedford on thursday accused of encouraging the death of conrad roy iii , who gassed himself in his truck in fairhaven last july .
during the hearing her defense attorney requested the case be moved out of bristol county , saying it 's ' impossible ' for carter to receive a fair trial in the area because the district attorney is the victim 's third cousin .
