a house used by five generations of the same family has been put on the market for the first time in 100 years .
the two-bedroom property in snodland , kent , was first rented by len and beatrice barnes in november 1915 .
the couple raised their son gordon and three daughters , freda , hilda and gwendoline in the property , which used to have an outside bathroom .
mr knott , a retired engineer who now lives with his family in maldon , essex , said the house means much to the family but the decision to sell it was ' inevitable ' .
