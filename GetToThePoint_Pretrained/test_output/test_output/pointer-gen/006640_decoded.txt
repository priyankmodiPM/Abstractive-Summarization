caitlin kellie-jones was diagnosed with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( hie ) , a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood .
it allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen .
thankfully , caitlin , now ten months old , recovered from hie and is able to feed and play .
