marvin `` papi gallo '' jones and ramon luis nicolas were in the middle of a bout when the black phone slipped out from jones ' black and red shorts at the ring .
referee frankie santore jr. went over to pick up the samsung galaxy and looked like he was chastising jones , who seemed confused .
jones later told tmz sports that he was listening to music before the fight on friday .
