tania rahman , 27 , was asked by salisbury city council if she wanted to run a stand at a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food ' .
but when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall , chit chaat chai , would not be allowed because it is not 'english-themed ' .
ms rahman , of andover , hampshire , was one of many food stall-holders who applied to take part in the event planned for sunday , april 26 .
