sbs news reporter jim carroll was reported to be taking a more ' commercial ' approach to the network by hiring 'good-looking , female , anglo-celtic ' journalists .
while carroll denies he is hiring based on these standards , many of the journalists hired since his appointment in 2013 have fit the above bill .
ellie laing , sbs news reporter who was hired by carroll , has now hit back at claims she was hired for her beauty over her brains .
