scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane â€“ a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide .
the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation .
serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor .
the reservoirs are secure , and scientists do n't believe they will impact climate change .
