josh darnbrough , 24 , slept , his mate rob gaskell , also 24 , inked the words ' if found face down call an ambulance ' on his back , using a diy kit .
josh tried to turn it into a cross , then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty , permanent mess on rob 's leg and causing his partner to go ' bonkers ' .
the prank has n't harmed the pair 's friendship - and the childhood friends , who are both having their tattoos removed , still see each other every day .
