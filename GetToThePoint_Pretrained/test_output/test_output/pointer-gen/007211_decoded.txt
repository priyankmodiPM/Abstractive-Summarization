palaeontologists in china say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago .
the strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist .
the dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flown through the air .
