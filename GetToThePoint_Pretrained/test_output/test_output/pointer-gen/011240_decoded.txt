president obama has ordered the release of 22 drug dealers - including eight who were serving life sentences .
nearly all of the offenders who obama granted clemency to were convicted of dealing addictive , hard drugs like crack cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin .
the effort is aimed at reducing harsh sentences for those who faced outdated guidelines at their time of sentencing and would be serving shorter punishments had they been convicted today .
