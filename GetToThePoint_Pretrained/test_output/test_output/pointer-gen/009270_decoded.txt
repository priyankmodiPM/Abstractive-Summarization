runners taking part in a 10km fun run were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour .
instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route .
hayley james , who is four months pregnant and from poole , said : ' to have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable ' .
