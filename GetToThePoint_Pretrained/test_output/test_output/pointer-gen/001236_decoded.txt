joe burgess scored his first super league hat-trick as wigan won their first super league success in west yorkshire .
it was a third consecutive win for shaun wane 's men and a fifth from their last six matches but their hard-to-please coach will be far from happy with their performance and his mood will have worsened by a hamstring injury to centre anthony gelling .
burgess , who is joining sydney roosters at the end of the year , scored three of the warriors ' seven tries in a 40-22 victory .
