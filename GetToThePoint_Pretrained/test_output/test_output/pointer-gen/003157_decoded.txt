dr adrian quarterman , of dundee university , is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy .
the satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light .
the energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth .
