the boy , known only as hanghang , was using the old handset as an alarm when he woke up early for school and started to play with it .
he said the phone felt hot and blew up in his face , exposing part of his jawbone and embedding fragments in his arms and legs .
he underwent emergency surgery before he was sent to the burns unit and onto the plastic surgery inpatient department .
