rafa benitez is set to leave napoli this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services .
chelsea drew benitez 's first two games 0-0 , before a 3-1 defeat against west ham in a london derby .
benitez was made chelsea interim manager in 2012 but it 's fair to say the fans never warmed to him .
