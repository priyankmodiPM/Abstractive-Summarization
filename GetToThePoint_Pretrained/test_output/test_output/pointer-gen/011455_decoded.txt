biologists at goethe university frankfurt , germany , studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin .
they found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip .
the researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds that could speed up this process .
