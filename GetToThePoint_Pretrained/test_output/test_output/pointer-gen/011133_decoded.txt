ben stokes was involved in a war of words with west indies batsman marlon samuels last night after a opening day of the second test .
the two clashed repeatedly on the pitch and samuels later taunted the durham all-rounder , saying : ' the english boys donâ€™t learn .
he keeps on talking to me and he keeps on motivating me to carry on batting ' .
