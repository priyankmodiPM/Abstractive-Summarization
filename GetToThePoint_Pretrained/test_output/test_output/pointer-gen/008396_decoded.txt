the alarm failed at the former president 's houston residence in september 2013 and even though the secret service bought a replacement system in january 2014 .
it came despite an agent 's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm , which was installed in 1993 , be replaced because it ' had exceeded its life cycle ' .
despite the apparently relaxed security measures , there were no breaches at the property , where 90-year-old bush and his wife barbara have lived for two decades .
