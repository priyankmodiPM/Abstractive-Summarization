michael oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those .
oliver was more decisive when cesc fabregas went to ground after feeling contact from santi cazorla .
replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on fabregas ' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but once it was cleared he should have gone back , awards the penalty and cautioned ospina .
