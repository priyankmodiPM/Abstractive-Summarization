boredpanda has created a thread encouraging parents to showcase their ' true nerdy colours ' by dressing their babies up as sci-fi characters , like princess leia from star wars .
another baby is dressed up as widely-recognisable nintendo character mario , complete with tiny dungarees , the red flat cap and a fake felt moustache .
