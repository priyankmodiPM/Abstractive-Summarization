us scientists have found a way to use biogas to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't UNK the environment like fossil fuels .
the breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside UNK instead of lowering petrol into their motor .
researchers from india 's UNK hindu university may be close to solving this problem using olive UNK to store hydrogen in gas .
