a nine foot bull shark , named as the most dangerous sharks in the world , was captured swimming past a condo back yard on UNK island in florida .
the beast can be seen just under the water , with its distinctive pectoral fin breaking the surface .
owners are now asking the city to designate the area for swimming only .
