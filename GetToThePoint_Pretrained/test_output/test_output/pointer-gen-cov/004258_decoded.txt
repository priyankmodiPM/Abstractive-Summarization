mar√≠a jose carrascosa , a 49-year-old native of spain , was released from jail friday night , the record reported .
carrascosa , formerly of fort lee , was paroled last year after moving her daughter , then 5 , to spain when the girl 's father was granted custody of the child .
carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the united states and thus remained jailed nearly nine years .
