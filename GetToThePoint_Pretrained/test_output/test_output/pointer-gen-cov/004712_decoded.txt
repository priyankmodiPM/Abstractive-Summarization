jay brittain , 63 , was worried that the baby owls at small breeds farm park and owl centre , herefordshire , look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them , which can be fatal for the birds .
the first born tawny owl is given orange talons , the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born , pink .
