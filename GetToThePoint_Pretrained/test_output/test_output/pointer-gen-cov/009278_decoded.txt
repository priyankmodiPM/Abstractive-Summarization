military leaders in norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour 's presence on its ' strategically important ' coastline following a spike in tensions between russia and nato nations .
some experts have criticised the shutting down of olavsvern naval base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009 .
but fears have once again peaked after three russian ships spent the entire winter docked inside a closed naval base in february .
it was originally shut because the country 's leaders thought the threat from moscow was reduced .
