the whales , which are in fact a species of dolphin , were found washed up along a 6-mile ( 10km ) stretch of the pacific coast of hokato , around 60 miles ( 100km ) north of tokyo .
the fears appeared to be based on the appearance of 50 melon-headed whales six days before the devastating undersea earthquake in 2011 that caused a tsunami and left 19,000 people dead .
