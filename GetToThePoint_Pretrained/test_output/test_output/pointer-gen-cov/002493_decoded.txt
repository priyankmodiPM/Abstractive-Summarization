david haye , 34 , was arrested at dubai international airport and held in a police cell over a Â£341,000 bounced cheque .
the boxer , who has not fought since he defeated dereck chisora in 2012 , also handed over his passport to authorities , and has been unable to leave the united arab emirates .
the cheque , worth 1.8million emirati dirham , was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property , as part of a deal with developers emaar , which is part-owned by the dubai government .
haye has said the ' bounced ' cheque was down to an administrative error .
