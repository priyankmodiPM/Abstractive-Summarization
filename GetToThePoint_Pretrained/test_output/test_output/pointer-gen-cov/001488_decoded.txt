lucian faggiano bought the building in lecce , puglia in the south of italy .
renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked .
mr faggiano , 60 , and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 via ascanio grandi .
