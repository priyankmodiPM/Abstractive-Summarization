the toys include a long ' tail ' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button , and then watch on the tv as the animals react and play with them .
the system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different toys at the shelter with the push of a button , and then watch on the tv in their room as the animals react and play with them .
plans to sell a version for pet owners via kickstarter next month .
