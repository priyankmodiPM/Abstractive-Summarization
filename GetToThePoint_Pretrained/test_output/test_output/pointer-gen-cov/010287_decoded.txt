tony pulis returned to selhurst park for the first time since he left crystal palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his west bromwich albion side to the edge of safety .
alan pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit pulis but an early goal from james morrison and craig gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left palace two days before this season kicked off .
despite the timing of his departure , he won the premier league lma manager of the year award .
