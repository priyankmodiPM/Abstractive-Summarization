jurors hearing the boston marathon bombing trial are barred from attending this year 's race , a federal judge told the panel on tuesday as part of instructions ahead of the trial 's sentencing phase .
dzhokhar tsarnaev , 21 , was convicted last week of planting two homemade bombs at the crowded finish line of the world famous marathon in 2013 , killing three people and injuring 264 others .
the same jury that convicted tsarnaev will hear testimony on whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison for his crimes , starting next tuesday .
