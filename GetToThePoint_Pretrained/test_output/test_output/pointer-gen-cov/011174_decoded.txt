john howard , 66 , bled the overseas press and media association dry over two years .
the father-of-three had been a member of the overseas press and media association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago .
he was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed ' i 'm sorry ' to a former colleague as he left the dock at canterbury crown court .
howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay Â£20,000 .
