uefa have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of england women 's u19 european championships qualifier against norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake .
the elite round group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at seaview stadium in belfast on thursday with the match resuming with england retaking a penalty in the 96th minute .
england 's 3-1 group 4 victory against switzerland means the young lionesses will qualify for the european championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2 .
