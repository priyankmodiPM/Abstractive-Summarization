cole skuse 's first ipswich town goal , in their win against cardiff city , was a long time coming but boy was it worth the wait .
after 21 months and 82 appearances since he signed from bristol city in 2013 , skuse opened his account with a 30-yard effort which could barely have been struck sweeter .
the score was already 1-1 when bruno ecuele manga stretched to clear on the edge of the box and the ball bounced to skuse , who hit it first time then watched it fly in off the right post .
daryl murphy ( centre ) wraps up the win for ipswich with a third goal in the 90th minute .
