sutherland shire council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach .
among these locations are cronulla beach and wanda beach , both in southern sydney , as it was found due to a shortage of accommodation .
many locals have already had a negative response to the backpacker vans crowding the beachside streets .
