student drew hollinshead , 21 , stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement .
but as he helped her for less than a minute , a traffic warden put a £70 ticket on his car – because mr hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers .
mr hollinshead said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening .
