josh mason , who is standing in lib dem-held redcar , said his own party leader nick clegg was ' not the most popular ' .
he said that a visit from the party leader to the seat , which is currently held by the lib dems , would not ' do us any favours ' .
mr clegg has seen a dramatic collapse in his popularity since the heyday of the 2010 election campaign .
