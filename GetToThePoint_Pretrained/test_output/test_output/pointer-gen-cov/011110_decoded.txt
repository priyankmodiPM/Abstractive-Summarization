the man , wearing an orange high-vis jacket , could be seen leaning out sliding door of the black vauxhall vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the m40 near oxford .
he appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the kj rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle .
today his boss revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out because he was n't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air .
