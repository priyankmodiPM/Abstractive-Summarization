castleford 's blockbusting australian winger justin carney will be sidelined for up to two months after being told he needs to undergo elbow surgery .
the news could have been worse for carney , who dislocated his elbow in the tigers ' 25-4 win over hull kr last saturday but did not suffer a break as first feared .
castleford coach daryl powell expected to take carney 's place against widnes on sunday .
