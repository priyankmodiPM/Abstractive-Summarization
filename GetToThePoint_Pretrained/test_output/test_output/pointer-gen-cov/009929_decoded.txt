scottish professional football league has performed a u-turn by switching rangers ' final-day clash with hearts back to saturday , may 2 .
the league found itself at the centre of a furious row on wednesday after announcing it had moved gers ' tynecastle fixture with the jambos to may 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place .
the decision was made after tv broadcaster sky decided to screen the match live but hibs hit out at the change , claiming it would place the league 's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with rangers for the play-off slots .
