greece has been handed a list of reforms it must carry out in return for a new injection of cash from eurozone countries .
alexis tsipras met the russian president in moscow yesterday and the pair agreed a package of investment in energy and other projects .
but mr tsipras insisted he had not asked for – or received – financial aid , saying greece is a ' sovereign nation ' and ' not a debt colony ' .
