the pair , who are in their 30s , were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the ' raucous screams ' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in san martino .
the man , who has not been named , was sentenced to four months in prison in 2011 , and his fiancée given a noise abatement order .
but the couple appealed the sentence and have now been ordered to pay £7,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere , and £2,000 in legal fees .
