her parents said that jessica 's social media accounts were flooded with horrible sentiments the night before she died , and are now desperate to see a change within victoriaâ€™s government and the state 's police so that those found guilty of cyber bullying face serious consequences .
coroner jacqui hawkins said in the report she released in october that jessica 's death highlighted the impact that social media could have on the lives on young people , and that both facebook and text messaging was ' problematic ' .
