jenson button was left to reflect on ' not a great day ' and fears he will again be at the back of the grid for sunday 's bahrain grand prix .
button 's mclaren suffered an electrical fault that cut the engine and forced him into a spin at turn one of the bahrain international circuit .
although the car was recovered , his mechanics failed to fix the fault until just before the start of fp2 , in which three laps in he had to stop out on track .
