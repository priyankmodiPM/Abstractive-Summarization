mick tabone , 74 , previously owned and ran johnstone river crocodile farm and zoo in far-north queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989 .
for 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature 's back while he chatted to him , and never once felt as though he was in danger .
mr tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature , in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc .
