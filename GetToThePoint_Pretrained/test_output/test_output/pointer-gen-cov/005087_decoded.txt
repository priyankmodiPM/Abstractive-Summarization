robert tomanovich , who owns robert 's discount tree service in livonia , michigan , first hung a noose from a tree and a confederate flag , printed with the slogan ' i ai n't coming down , ' on a fence at his home .
when neighbours complained , a second noose appeared on a tree outside his tree-cutting business which operates at a second property on the same street .
tomanovich , 55 , has denied his actions are racist , although an employee has admitted that the second noose was a deliberate move to antagonise locals .
