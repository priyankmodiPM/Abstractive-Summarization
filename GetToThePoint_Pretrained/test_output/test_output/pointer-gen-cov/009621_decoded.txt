all of the 36 units at the redlands house sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an ' eyesore ' by local residents .
but the local council defended the colour scheme , claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home .
the 36 homes as they were before the council spent Â£750,000 including funds from the intermediate care fund on the renovation .
