alaskan husky , sarabi , escaped from handlers in anchorage but has been on the run for a month .
the three-year-old dog was spotted on april 15 near glenn highway and then again last friday near reverend tim carrick 's united protestant presbyterian church before being caught on monday night .
carrick and his family set up a cage trap in the woods between the church and his home , and used four bowls of dog kibbles , a pot of chicken stock , liverwurst and a motion activated camera to help capture sarabi .
