rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67p .
the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles ( 14km ) of the surface .
but during the manoeuvre , rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into ‘ safe mode’ , causing it to momentarily lose contact with earth .
