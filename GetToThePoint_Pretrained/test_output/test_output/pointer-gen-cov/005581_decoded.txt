jurors in decatur county , georgia ruled on thursday that the suv manufacturer , chrysler , acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of remington ' remi ' walden a 1999 jeep with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle .
walden ' remi ' walden , four , was killed when the jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck in march 2012 .
the verdict came nearly two years after chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks .
