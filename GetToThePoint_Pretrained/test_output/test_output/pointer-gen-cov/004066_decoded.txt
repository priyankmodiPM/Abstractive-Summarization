gary bowyer has hit out at fa cup rules which prevent him from fielding one of his own players against liverpool in wednesday night 's sixth round replay at ewood park because he was on loan when the first tie was played on march 9 .
bowyer , who has a lengthy injury list at his championship club , wanted to include 21-year-old midfielder john o'sullivan to face the reds having recalled him from a loan spell with league one barnsley last month .
o'sullivan was at oakwell when the initial 0-0 draw between the teams was played at anfield .
