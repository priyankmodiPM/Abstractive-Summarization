mary jane veloso 's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners , were put to death .
her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called `` execution island '' when a philippine tv crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution .
veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from malaysia to indonesia when $ 500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage .
