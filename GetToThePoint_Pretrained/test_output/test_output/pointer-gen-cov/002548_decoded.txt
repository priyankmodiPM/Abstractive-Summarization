former world champion ken doherty potted a final black and extinguished , for now , the dream of reanne evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of sheffield 's crucible theatre in the world snooker championship .
she advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that wo n't be bettered in this year 's qualifying tournament .
snooker 's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport 's blue-chip event on april 18 .
