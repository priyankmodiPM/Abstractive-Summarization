mick mccarthy was feeling less vibrant than his team 's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play-off places .
the tractor boys , who have now lost four of their last five away games , were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by huddersfield strike pair nahki wells and james vaughan .
mccarthy responded by making two changes at half-time and was rewarded when luke varney reduced arrears earlier in the second period .
james vaughan doubled the lead for the home side and dent ipswich 's play-off hopes .
