juan mata described manchester united 's 4-2 derby victory as a ' massive win ' as they opened up a four-point gap on manchester city .
united had lost their last four meetings with city but goals from ashley young , marouane fellaini , mata and chris smalling gave the red devils their biggest derby win for six years .
sergio aguero opened the scoring and also netted late on for his 100th city goal but united were by far the better team to tighten their grip on third spot .
