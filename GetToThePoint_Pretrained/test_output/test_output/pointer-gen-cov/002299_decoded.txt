steve simonsen served a one-game ban after he admitted breaking the sfa 's zero-tolerance gambling rules by betting on a total of 50 games in a year .
but sfa compliance officer tony mcglennan challenged that decision , claiming his punishment was ' unduly lenient ' .
simonsen 's legal team from the prolegal group have confirmed the englishman will not face a further suspension after the sfa 's appeal was rejected by an appellate tribunal .
