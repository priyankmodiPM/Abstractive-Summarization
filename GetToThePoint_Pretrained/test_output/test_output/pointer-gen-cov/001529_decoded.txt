the 9th us circuit court of appeals confirmed that the washington supreme court did not act unreasonably when it rejected clark elmoreâ€™s claim his constitutional rights were violated at trial .
elmore , who was convicted of killing kristy ohnstad in bellingham after he said she threatened to reveal he had molested her as a child , received the federal court 's ruling on wednesday .
elmore claimed his rights were violated during the trial because his attorney gave him bad advice and the jury saw him in shackles .
