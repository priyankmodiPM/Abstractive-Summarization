huw thomas , the labour candidate in ceredigion , west wales , suggested on an online forum in 2006 that the flags were for a ' simpleton ' or a ' casual racist ' .
he posted his views on a welsh language website called mais e writing during the 2006 world cup : ' i agree it is totally sickening the number of english flags to be seen around wales ' .
mr thomas said he made the comments as ' a young student ' and he no longer held those views .
