richard cockerill believes this season 's aviva premiership will run until the final day of regular league season action .
the tigers tackle saracens at allianz park on saturday , separated by just two points and two places with only four games left .
while northampton are clear at the top , it is a different story for the three remaining play-off positions , with saracens , bath , leicester and exeter all bunched up behind saints , and mid-table wasps also can not be discounted .
leicester tigers rugby director richard cockerill believes the premiership title will go to the wire .
