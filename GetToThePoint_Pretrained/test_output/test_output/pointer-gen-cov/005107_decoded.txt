the bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple brian and charlotte smith , who have travelled across the us to photograph the monuments .
the concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways , showing pilots the direction needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail .
