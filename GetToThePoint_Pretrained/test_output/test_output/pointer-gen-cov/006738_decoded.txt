maarij khan and his mother mushammat are set to be removed from their home in newcastle after the home office turned down their bid to remain in the uk .
now 3,500 people have signed a petition to allow the schoolboy and his mother to stay in britain , where maarij 's 10-year-old brother saffat is buried .
saffat was subsequently diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma , a type of rhabdomyosarcoma which attacks connective tissue in the face and left him severely disfigured .
