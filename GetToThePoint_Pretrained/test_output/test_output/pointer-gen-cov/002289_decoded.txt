james anderson induced an edge from west indies captain denesh ramdin on the final day of the first test in antigua for his 384th test scalp on friday , breaking sir ian botham 's record which had stood for 23 years .
anderson , 32 , broke the record in the same match which saw him collect his landmark 100th cap for england , although there was disappointment as england could not force a victory .
anderson said he had no intention of setting himself targets in terms of either tests played or wickets taken for england .
