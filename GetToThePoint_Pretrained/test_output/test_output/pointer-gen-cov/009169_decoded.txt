dr omar saadi al-atraqchi , 42 , faces being struck off the medical register making him unable to continue working at the custom house surgery in newham , east london as well as other surgeries in north london after he admitted secretly filming men in the gym .

he then slid the device under the partition of shower cubicles so he could secretly film men next door to him .
