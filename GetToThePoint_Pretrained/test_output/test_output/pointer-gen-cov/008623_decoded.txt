ephedra foeminea , the plant waits for the full moon to ' bloom ' , is the only plant species so far that’s known to behave in this way .
they ooze from the plant’s female organs where seeds are produced .
when a nocturnal butterfly or insect lands on one of the tasty transparent orbs at night , the pollen it’s carrying is used to fertilise the seed .
