snp leader nicola sturgeon hit back at claims from tory former prime minister sir john major over her demand to play a role in proper up a labour government , when she is ' not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself .
sir john said that he had repeatedly warned in the 1990s that devolution to scotland would make independence more , not less , likely .
he warned of ' mayhem ' if the snp holds the balance of power , with a weak labour government open to a ' daily dose of blackmail ' .
