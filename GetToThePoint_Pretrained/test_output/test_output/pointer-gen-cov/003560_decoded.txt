mayor of new york is allegedly entering the race as a ' leftist ' alternative to clinton in the hopes that this will see him represent the party in the 2016 elections .
this claims come in the wake of a television appearance last week , just hours before clinton announced her candidacy , where de blasio refused to back her .
the 53-year-old has yet to back clinton , despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her u.s. senate bid in 2000 .
