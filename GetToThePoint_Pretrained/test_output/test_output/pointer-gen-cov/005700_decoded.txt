ronald butcher , a ' private and quiet man ' , bequeathed his Â£500,000 fortune to a builder when he died in 2013 .
but his relatives and family friends insist that the will , made just two months before his death , is invalid and say that the builder is lying about his friendship with mr butcher .
the three were the equal beneficiaries of a will drawn up by mr butcher in december 2011 , but after his death they discovered that they had been disinherited .
