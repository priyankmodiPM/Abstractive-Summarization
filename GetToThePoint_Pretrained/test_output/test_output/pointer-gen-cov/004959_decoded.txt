karim benzema hailed team-mate cristiano ronaldo as a ' phenomenon ' after the portuguese struck five goals in real madrid 's 9-1 mauling of granada .
it was the first time in his career that ronaldo has scored five goals in a single match and saw him become only the third player to reach the 300-goal mark for madrid , a tally achieved in only 287 appearances .
benzema also scored twice after gareth bale had opening the scoring as madrid 's much-vaunted ' bbc ' strikeforce combined to score eight of their side 's nine goals .
