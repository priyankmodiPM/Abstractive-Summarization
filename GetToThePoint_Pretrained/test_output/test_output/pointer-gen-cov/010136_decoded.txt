hollywood-born chanteuse charlene had a surprise worldwide hit with i 've never been to me .
when the song became a hit she was in straitened financial circumstances and working in a sweetshop in ilford , essex , so instead of moving like harlow she could have been singing about moving to harlow .
one of the most irritating lyrics in the song - it has many - is when she sings about the ' isle of greece ' .
