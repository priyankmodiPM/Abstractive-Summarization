police in ragusa , a sicilian port town , arrested three syrian men .
it is thought the smugglers had charged each person $ 8,500 ( £5,700 ) to make the crossing , with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of £536,000 .
this is far more than the usual cost of between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - or £536,000 - to cross the mediterranean to europe .
