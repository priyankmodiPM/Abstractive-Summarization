peter reece , his fiancee , baby daughter and mother from kent parked on an ocean shores beach on thursday around 7pm in their new nissan infiniti when their tires got stuck in the sand .
the tide was 30 feet from where they were parked , but within a few minutes it was hitting their car .
reece and his fiancee were able to get out of the car , but the grandmother and child were stuck in the car because the wet sand surrounding them was keeping the doors shut .
