thomas cain 's mother ora mae died in 1943 , when he was just 12 years old .
but this footage , recorded in 2013 , shows the moment his enterprising granddaughter , andrea ferrell , gave him an old photograph she acquired from a distant relative .
in the video she hands mr cain her present , which dates from the 1920s and shows his mother as a teenager , while his family encourage him .
