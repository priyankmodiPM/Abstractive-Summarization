the merfin , a rubber monofin that mimics the experience of swimming like a mermaid , looks set to be the essential piece of beach play kit this summer .
the product is the brainchild of australian professional freediver kazzie mahina .
the 37-year-old , from byron bay in new south wales , created the flippers in the shape of a mermaid tail to allow kids and adults alike to streak through the ocean like an underwater creature .
