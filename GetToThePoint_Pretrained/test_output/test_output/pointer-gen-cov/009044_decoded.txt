twelve-year-old alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an mri scan at the animal health trust clinic in newmarket , suffolk .
the pet , who is also completely deaf , had the scan , last month after his owner noticed a lump behind his ear .
she then took him to a local vet , where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back .
alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal , but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns .
