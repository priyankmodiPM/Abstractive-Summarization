cordula schacht is suing a publisher for royalties over a biography that used extracts from his diaries .
the dispute comes after peter longerich , a leading authority on the holocaust and nazi germany , drew on the diaries for a biography called goebbels , which was published in germany in 2010 .
mr dresen has suggested to schacht in court that royalties could be paid if she were to donate them subsequently to a holocaust charity .
