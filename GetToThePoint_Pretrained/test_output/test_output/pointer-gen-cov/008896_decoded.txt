rodrigo gularte , 42 , asked ' am i being executed ? ' as he was being chained up to be transported to the jungle clearing on nusakambangan island where he and seven other death row inmates were killed by firing squad in the early hours of wednesday morning .
irish priest appointed to be gularte 's spiritual advisor in his final hours said he talked to gularte for an hour and a half late on tuesday night to prepare him for the executions , but the convicted drug trafficker was confused about his fate .
gularte was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into indonesia .
