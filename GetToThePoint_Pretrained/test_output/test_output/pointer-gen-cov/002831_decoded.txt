officer michael slager , 33 , charged with murder after opening fire on walter scott , 50 , after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light in north charleston , south carolina , on saturday .
his attorney andy savage told cbs that slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any other detainees at charleston county jail .
he said that when he met slager on wednesday for 60 minutes , that it took an hour and 45 minutes to move the north charleston police officer to the meeting place because they had to clear all of the cell blocks .
