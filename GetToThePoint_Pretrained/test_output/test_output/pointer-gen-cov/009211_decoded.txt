budget airline easyjet has been charging stranded customers a Â£10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled .
the charge came to light when easyjet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after french air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month .
the association of european airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this .
