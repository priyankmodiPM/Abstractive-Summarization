the short film has been developed on an oculus rift by italy 's university of udine 's hci lab .
it is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water .
the video is based on an actual event when , on january 15 , 2009 , u.s. airways flight 1549 was forced into a landing on water .
