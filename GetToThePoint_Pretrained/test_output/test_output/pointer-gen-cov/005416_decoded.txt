brian gemmell , a former captain in the intelligence corps , said spy chiefs ordered him to ‘ stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the northern ireland children’s’ home .
he spoke out during a meeting with victim richard kerr , who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by ‘ very powerful’ figures in a westminster paedophile gang .
campaigners claim mr kerr’s account provides a clear link between vip paedophile rings in london and belfast .
