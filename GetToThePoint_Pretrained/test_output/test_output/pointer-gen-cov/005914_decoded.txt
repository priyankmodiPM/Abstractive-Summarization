fast bowler jimmy anderson made cricket history in the caribbean on friday by beating the great sir ian botham 's all-time england wicket-taking record with his 384th victim in his hundredth test .
anderson 's marquee moment in his landmark test arrived in his 21st over when crucially for his team , he had west indies captain dennis ramdin caught by captain alastair cook .
botham 's record had been equalled much earlier in the day when anderson had marlon samuel caught in the gully by james treadwell .
botham was watching the test while on media duties with sky sports , where he is commentating .
