crystal palace manager alan pardew insists manchester city can come from behind again to snatch the barclays premier league title from chelsea .
city overtook liverpool with one match to go before being crowned champions last season and in 2012 , sergio aguero 's injury-time strike in the final game sank manchester united on goal difference .
chelsea are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but pardew , whose palace side host city on monday , believes the race is far from over .
pardew has no fresh injury concerns ahead of the match against city .
