exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in chibok , northeastern nigeria .
shame that when such horrendous acts occur , our collective attention span is so fleeting .
my heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary .
