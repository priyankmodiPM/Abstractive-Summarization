an idyllic two-bedroom log cabin , nestled down a private country lane in the new forest , has gone on the market for Â£350,000 .
the 76sq ft hideaway , based near the tiny hampshire hamlet of newgrounds , is made entirely from timber imported from norway .
its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere .
