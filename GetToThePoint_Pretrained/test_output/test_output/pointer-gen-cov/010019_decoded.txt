england cricket board chairman giles clarke chose one of the most prestigious cricket occasions of the year , the wisden almanack launch , to make a complete fool of himself .
clarke arrived upset that the new ecb regime had just sacked his england managing director appointment , paul downton , whom he had rashly called a ‘ man of great judgment’ .
clarke had been granted a two-page platform in last year’s almanack to explain his icc strategy .
