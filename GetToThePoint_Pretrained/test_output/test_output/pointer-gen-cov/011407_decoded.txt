scientists at a polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products .
the liquid is called shear-thickening fluid ( stf ) , and instantly hardens upon impact at any temperature .
in a ' liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area .
