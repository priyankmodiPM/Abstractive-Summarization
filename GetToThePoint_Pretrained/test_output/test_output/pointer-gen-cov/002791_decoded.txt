two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the arabian sea .
one of the carriers involved , dubai-based emirates , referred to the apparent near-miss as an ' air traffic control incident ' in a statement on wednesday .
however a resolution advisory ( ra ) was given to both planes , which means the distance between the two aircraft could have resulted in a collision within 25 seconds .
the incident occurred on monday as passenger planes from emirates and etihad airways were traveling in opposite directions .
