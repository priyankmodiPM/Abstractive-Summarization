florida community has voiced objection to plans of a forensic research ' body farm ' in which human bodies will be left in florida elements for extended periods of time .
the body farm , which would be located in lithia , is a joint project between the university of south florida institute of anthropology and the hillsborough county sheriff 's office .
if the research is approved by the hillsborough county commission , the information gathered at the site could help investigators solve crimes and cold cases .
