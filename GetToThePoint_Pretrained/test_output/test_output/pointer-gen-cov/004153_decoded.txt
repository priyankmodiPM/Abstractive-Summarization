nigel farage 's campaigning got off to a faltering start today as he missed a ukip event after getting stuck in traffic .
the ukip leader was expected at a farm in staffordshire as he prepared to attack the government over defence spending .
but organisers pulled the plug while he was trapped in his chauffeur-driven car .
mr farage faced ridicule last year when he blamed immigrants clogging up the m4 .
