tabby cat george turned up 128 miles from its home after apparently hitching a ride in a caravan .
george was last seen running off in the direction of a caravan park near his home in north wales five weeks later .
he has now been reunited with his owners after julia hill , who found the 18-year-old tabby outside her home in calderdale last week .
