sidonie , a well known band from catalonia , created a rather tongue-in-cheek song during a recent ryanair flight to santiago de compostela in northern spain .
the group , who posted the performance video to facebook and youtube , explained that they composed the tune after experiencing a ' lack of respect shown by ryanair flight attendants ' .
ryanair , however , was n't as impressed with the band 's performance .
