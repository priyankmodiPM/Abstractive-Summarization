domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .
but today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .
italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed .
