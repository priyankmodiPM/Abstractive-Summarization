nigel benn , who now lives in australia and works as a charity worker , looked as sharp as ever as he joined in a playful pad session with ricky hatton at his manchester gym .
benn landed a series of punches , including one that saw hatton 's glove fly off , as he put the 36-year-old through his paces following his return to england .
earlier this week , hatton and benn met up to discuss the possibility of the ‘ hitman ' training conor benn , nigel’s son , ahead of the 2016 olympics in rio .
