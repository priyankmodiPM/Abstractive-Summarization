arsene wenger has revealed he only makes the final decision on his starting line-up on the morning of the match - and agonises over the selection all week .
arsene wenger said : ' i always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game , but there 's always a doubt on one or two .
' when two players are together in your mind , competing for one position , every single detail can go for one of them - experience , confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference .
