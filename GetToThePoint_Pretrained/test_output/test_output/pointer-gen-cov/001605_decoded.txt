toni elliot , 53 , thought she had hurt a tooth when she sat for dinner at puckett 's boat house in franklin , tennessee , on thursday .
when she spat out the mouthful she was chewing she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand .
elliot 's boat house thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties .
puckett 's boat house says it gets their oysters from the gulf of mexico off louisiana .
