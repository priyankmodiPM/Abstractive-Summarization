prime minister david cameron will announce an extension of the right-to-buy scheme which will allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home .
but the national housing federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers Â£5.8billion .
labour jumped on the remarks this morning , claiming the policy had ' unravelled ' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off .
