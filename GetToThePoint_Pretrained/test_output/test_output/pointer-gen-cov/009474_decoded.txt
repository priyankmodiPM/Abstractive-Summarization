manchester city will resist any attempt by valencia to pull out of a Â£24million deal for alvaro negredo to fund a move for radamel falcao .
negredo joined valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a compulsory purchase clause that triggered a permanent move to the mestalla as soon as he played for the la liga club .
