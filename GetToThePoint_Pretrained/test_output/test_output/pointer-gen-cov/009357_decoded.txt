undersheriff tim albin , of the tulsa county sheriff 's office in oklahoma , quit his job monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer robert bates , 73 .
bates , a millionaire insurance broker , had made substantial donations to the department in previous years .
he has been charged with manslaughter - but a judge allowed him to take a month-long holiday to the bahamas before his day in court .
albin was named in a 2009 internal investigation released friday that showed deputies had expressed concerns about bates ' performance .
