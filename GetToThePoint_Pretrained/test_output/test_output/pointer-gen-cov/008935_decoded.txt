the australian government has won its bid to ban the boss of the nation 's biggest bikie gang from australia after the federal court ruled unanimously against alex vella re-entering the country .
vella has painted himself as a nelson mandela-like figure and sold stubby holders and t-shirts to fund his legal battle , pay all court costs .
the decision strands vella in malta , leaving behind in australia 24 close family members including a wife , sons and an elderly mother .
