linda hunter says she is stuck in a ' ghetto ' after liverpool city council offered to sell homes in her street for £1 .
but eight years ago , the street became part of a regeneration scheme and the council bought properties and boarded them up ready for demolition .
estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than £1 as other houses in the street are being sold off at that price by the council .
