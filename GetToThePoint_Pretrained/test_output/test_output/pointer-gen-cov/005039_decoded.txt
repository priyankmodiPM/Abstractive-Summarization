harry kane awaits his chance to impress in a crossbar challenge during open training at white hart lane on thursday morning .
harry kane , nabil bentaleb , eric dier , roberto soldado , danny rose and the apparent king of the crossbar , christian eriksen , ignoring attempts from his team-mates to distact him , all went narrowly over the top .
kane 's third go was no good but a fourth out of shot hit the mark and won a big cheer , though could n't count .
