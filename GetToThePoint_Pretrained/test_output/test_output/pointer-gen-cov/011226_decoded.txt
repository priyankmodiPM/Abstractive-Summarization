robbie knievel , 52 , was speeding in an suv on tuesday evening when he rear-ended a honda , causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars .
officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol , but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample .
knievel says knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but did n't give officers a name .
he received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $ 600 in fines .
