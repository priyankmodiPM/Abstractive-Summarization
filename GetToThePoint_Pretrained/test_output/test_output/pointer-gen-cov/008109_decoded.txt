scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed .
the device was implanted into middle aged rats , sending out minute electrical impulses , and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated .
dbs is a surgical procedure that has become an established nhs treatment for parkinson 's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs .
