dustin johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on friday .
the youngest first-round leader in masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under set by ray floyd way back in 1976 .
it also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major , set by three others , including sir nick faldo at the open .
johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the courseâ€™s scoreable par fives to devastating effect .
