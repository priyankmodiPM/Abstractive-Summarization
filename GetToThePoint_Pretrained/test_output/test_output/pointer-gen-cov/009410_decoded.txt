self-styled ' anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in london 's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading ' homes for all ' .
it is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on facebook by the group simply calls for ' christmas lights ... any and all radical/revolutionary messages ' .
but banners bearing messages such as ' better squat than let homes rot ' .
