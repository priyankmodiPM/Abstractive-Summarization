harry the ginger tom was hit by a police car near tony hunt’s home .
but instead of tracking down the owner and explaining what had happened , the officers involved knocked on a neighbour’s door and asked for a black bin bag .
mr hunt spent two days putting up ‘ lost cat’ posters in his area before finding out what had happened from a local teenager .
