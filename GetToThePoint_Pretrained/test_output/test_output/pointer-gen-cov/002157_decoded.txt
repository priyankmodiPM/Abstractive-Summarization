teachers are set to call for ' play in the curriculum ' for schoolchildren up to seven as this is more suitable than educating them in a formal way .
many children are not ready to sit down and do reading , writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five .
teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills .
