annegret raunigk , a primary school teacher from berlin , will create medical history when she becomes the oldest mother of four in a single birth in the world .
her gynaecologist initially mentioned the possibility of a ' selective reduction ' , where one or more fetuses is aborted in a multi-fetal pregnancy , but she declined .
but the english and russian teacher , who is due to retire this year , said she decided to have the babies as she was ‘ still quite fit’ and capable of looking after them .
