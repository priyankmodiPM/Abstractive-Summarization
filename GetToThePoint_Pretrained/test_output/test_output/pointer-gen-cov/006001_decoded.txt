the hatton garden gem heist missed the most crucial cctv footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later .
the worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on monday last week , believing detectives would already have similar images of the £60m raid .
scotland yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist , with the ex-head of the flying squad john o’connor criticising the decision .
