there were at least three reports of people trying to release gopher tortoises in the ocean .
there were all five species of sea turtle and the gopher turtle nest in the sand which is why some people may confuse one with the other .
the commission also said that one can tell the difference between a sea turtle and a tortoise by looking at the animal 's feet .
