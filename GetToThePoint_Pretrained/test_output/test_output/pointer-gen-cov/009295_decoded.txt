the 500ft-long oryol was in dock at zvezdochka shipyard in severodvinsk , 620 miles north of moscow , on the white sea .
the submarine 's dry dock was filled with water to put out the fire - a move taken after news agencies carried reports saying the emergency was already over .
defence sources said the submarine 's nuclear reactor had been removed before the fire broke out .
