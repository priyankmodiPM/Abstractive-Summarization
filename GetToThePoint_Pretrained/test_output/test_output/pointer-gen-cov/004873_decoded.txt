facebook has launched a new app called hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number is n't stored in your contacts book .
it pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user 's facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers .
it is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful .
