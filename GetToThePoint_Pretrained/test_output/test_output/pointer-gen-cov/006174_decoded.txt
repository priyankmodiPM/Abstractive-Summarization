christopher swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm wednesday in brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway .
he swam about an hour into the canal in a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water 's pollution because the experience was like ' swimming ' in a dirty diaper ' .
swain , who has previously swam the hudson and columbia rivers , said that cleanup of the gowanus canal , which was labelled as a superfund site by the epa , should be accelerated .
