kezzia french , 46 , thought she had laid six-month-old andrea to rest in 1999 .
but only found out more than a decade later that police had removed virtually all her vital organs .
the little girl died after being flung at a wall by her father , meyrick fowler , then 24 , who flew into a rage when his lottery number 's did n't come up at their home in ipswich .
it was only two years after police admitted that her brain had been cremated in 2009 , after it had been sent to a hospital in sheffield for examination , without their knowledge .
