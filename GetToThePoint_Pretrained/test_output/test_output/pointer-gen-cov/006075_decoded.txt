frank knight , 67 , posted an apology on his facebook account last week to blackpool and the oyston family , who run the fylde coast club , over allegations he made on his social network account last year .
knight said he had agreed to pay damages of Â£20,000 to the sky bet championship club , which prompted fellow seasiders supporter joe atherton to set up an account on the website gofundme.com where fans could pledge donations .
supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games .
