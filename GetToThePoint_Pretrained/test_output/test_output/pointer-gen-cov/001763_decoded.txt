tom moffatt , 27 , from ashton-under-lyne in tameside , greater manchester , was meant to ink ' riley ' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm - but accidentally spelled it incorrectly .
but instead of the letter ' l ' , mr moffatt started needling ' p ' and had to urgently ' scribble ' over the mistake .
he also attempted to mark himself with riley 's nickname ' sonny boy ' - but ended up scratching ' sony boy ' across his knuckles instead .
