tony blair has been dragged into a bitter row in mongolia .
the former premier made an unannounced visit to ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government , which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption .
he met new mongolian prime minister chimed saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage western investment to increase gold , copper and coal mining .
ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures .
