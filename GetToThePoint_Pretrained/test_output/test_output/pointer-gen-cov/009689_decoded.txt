dallas architects matt mooney and michael gooden have transformed 14 shipping containers into a stunningly modern home .
the home , dubbed 'pv14 ' , boasts a 1,400 sq ft roof deck that can fit up to 150 people , a 40ft long swimming pool on the ground floor and a 360 degree view of the city 's downtown .
mooney wanted to stay true to the materials that built his home and thus all the ceilings were left exposed .
