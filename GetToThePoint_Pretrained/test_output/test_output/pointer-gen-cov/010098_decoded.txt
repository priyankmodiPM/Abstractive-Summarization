stuart broad came through an injury scare and jonny bairstow fell just short of a century against his own team-mates as england 's test warm-ups descended into a glorified training drill .
it seemed entirely in keeping with the unsatisfactory nature of england 's test preparation week that bairstow , the only member of the seconded quarter not likely to feature in the series , had the most productive day .
jonathan trott ( nought ) and gary ballance ( 17 ) largely failed to do so , but bairstow made 98 and joe root ended the day 87 not out in a score of 303 for nine .
