the extra stretch of coastline on shiretoko peninsula near rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places .
geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby , when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop , pivoting the underwater area into the air .
the mass , which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level , measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long , and 100ft wide , a town official said .
