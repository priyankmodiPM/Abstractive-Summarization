inter milan sporting director piero ausilio has admitted being left feeling ' sad ' after the club lost patience and decided to sell philippe coutinho to liverpool .
the brazil playmaker arrived at anfield for just Â£8.5million in 2013 and has progressed to become one of the premier league 's most revered players , including a nomination for the pfa player of the year award this term .
inter signed coutinho as a teenager from brazilian club vasco de gama , but he failed to establish himself at the san siro despite being handed his debut by rafa benitez as an 18-year-old .
rafa used him on the flanks in a 4-2-3-1 formation .
