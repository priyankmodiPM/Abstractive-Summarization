le manoir aux quat'saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and mum is such a huge fan of raymond blanc she once confessed he could be her mastermind subjectâ€¦ .
the impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns , bronze sculptures ( including a scarecrow based on blanc himself ) , pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden .
le manoir boasts stunning grounds , luxury accommodation and blanc 's two michelin-starred restaraunt .
