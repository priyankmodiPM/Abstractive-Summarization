scientists in america found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent .
research carried out by scientists at texas tech university showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of £100,000 would only have £63,000 today .
