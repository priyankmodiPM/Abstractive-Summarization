father hamish baillie claims lord janner abused him during a game of hide-and-seek in a park , when he was a 15-year-old resident of a children’s home .
one of the nine victims who had been lined up to give evidence against the former leicester west mp waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘ beggars belief’ – and claimed it points to an establishment cover-up .
he believes lord janner was ‘steered’ in his direction by the care home’s manager , frank beck – a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences .
