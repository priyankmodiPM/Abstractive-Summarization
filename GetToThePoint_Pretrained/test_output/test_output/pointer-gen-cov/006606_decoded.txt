cardiff city will have no supporters present at saturday 's championship game against leeds united at elland road after the welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets .
both clubs have a history of fan trouble but leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club , council or police , when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans .
leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that cardiff will not take up any of their seats at elland road .
