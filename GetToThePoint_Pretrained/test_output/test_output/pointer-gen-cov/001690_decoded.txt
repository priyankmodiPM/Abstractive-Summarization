james hayward had arrived at east midlands airport with his parents , phil , 44 , and hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to lanzarote .
but security officers , who were described as 'over-zealous ' by the boy 's father , took exception to james 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's x-ray machines .
dad phil has labelled the security checks ' ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation .
