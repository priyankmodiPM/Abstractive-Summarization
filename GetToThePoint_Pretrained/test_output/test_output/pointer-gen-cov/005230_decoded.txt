martin keown joined aston villa in the wembley dressing room after beating liverpool to reach this year 's fa cup final .
villa were one of the founder members of the football league and in the early years of the fa cup , the trophy was almost theirs to keep .
now with sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side .
