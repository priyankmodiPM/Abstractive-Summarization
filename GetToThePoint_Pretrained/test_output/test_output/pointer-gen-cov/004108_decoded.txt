albert webb , 51 , and sons jimmy chuter , 26 , and jesse webb , 19 , followed people aged up to 97 home from the post office after they had collected their pensions before demanding money .
if the victim had no money on them , they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it , or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them .
most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s .
