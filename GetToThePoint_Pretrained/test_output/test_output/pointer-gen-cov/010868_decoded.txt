eric lanlard is on-stage recalling how he once refused to bake a ' very rude ' cake for naomi campbell .
her pa said : `` but it 's for naomi ! '' i told her that i did n't care if it was for the queen .
as it happens , when hm toured the cruise ship britannia after the naming ceremony last month , one of the areas she was most impressed with was eric 's atrium-based market caf√© , where the centrepiece is a beautiful , mouth-watering display : dainty , neon-hued raspberry macaroons , eton mess served with popping candy and chocolate salted caramel mille-feuilles .
