marlon samuels found a novel way of carrying on his duel in the second test with ben stokes here on thursday night when he sent him on his way with a military-style salute .
stokes had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a devendra long-hop long-hop straight to deep square leg and samuels wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds .
stokes looks at samuels as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the send-off .
