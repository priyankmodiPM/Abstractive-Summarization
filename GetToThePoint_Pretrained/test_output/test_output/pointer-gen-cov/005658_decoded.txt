real estate heir and suspected murderer robert durst has sent a bizarre letter to a reporter that shares no details about his alleged crime , but observations about life in los angeles .
the letter , post-marked april 1st in baton rouge , specifically states that durst ' said nothing about charges , crimes or trials ' but rambles on about durst 's thoughts on life in southern california .
durst , who was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend , pleaded not guilty to weapons charges on thursday .
he is escorted to prison after his arraignment on march 17 .
