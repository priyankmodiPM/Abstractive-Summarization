volcano calbuco , which has laid dormant for more than 40 years , erupted on wednesday causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee the 'apocalypse-like ' event .
hundreds filmed the eruption , near the southern port city of puerto montt , chile , and its deadly ash cloud caused all nearby flights to be grounded for safety .
but one amateur cameraman was surprised to see what appeared to be white lights close to the enormous plume of ash and smoke rising from the mouth of the volcano .
