hsbc ordered to pay £500 to the couple for their ‘ distress and inconvenience’ over the ‘ unfair application of its age policy’ .
the couple , who do not wish to be named , applied for the joint interest-only mortgage over 18 years on their home , in which they held substantial equity .
hsbc was criticised for refusing to grant the £250,000 loan because the husband would have been over 65 when the 18-year-deal finished .
