an 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three , six and eight , were trapped on a sandbank at blackpool beach while out walking during the school break .
but when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble , those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help .
the incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the boat race in london on saturday .
