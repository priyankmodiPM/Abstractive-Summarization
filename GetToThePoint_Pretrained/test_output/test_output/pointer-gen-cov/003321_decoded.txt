nico rosberg accused his own mercedes team of putting him ‘ under pressure’ during qualifying for the chinese grand prix .
rosberg was the final driver out of the pit-lane during qualifying meaning he had to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked to start his final shot at usurping hamilton before the chequered flag fell .
rosberg improved his time , but still fell agonisingly short of hamilton’s best lap .
