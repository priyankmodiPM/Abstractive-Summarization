seven female students , some of whom attend brigham young university in utah , were catfished by the same 24-year-old woman who was pretending to be a man .
the victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a woman named kayla in texas .
kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out who she was because it 's ' difficult ' to be both gay and mormon .
