chris christie appeared on the tonight show ( above ) and called out jimmy fallon for his weight jokes about the governor .
fallon however pulled out two spoons thinking the men could share the ice cream , at which point christie took the treat for himself , slowly moving away .
christie meanwhile has not yet announced if he plans to run for president in the upcoming election .
