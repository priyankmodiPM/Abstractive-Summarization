labour peer john prescott has defended prince charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers .
former deputy prime minister said he can not see a problem with the future king writing to government ministers and insisted he had ' a lot to offer this country ' .
lord prescott 's intervention comes after the supreme court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of prince charles 's ' black spider ' memos .
