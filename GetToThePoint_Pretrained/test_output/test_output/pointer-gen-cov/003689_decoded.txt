ruben blundell 's brother was four days overdue when his mother finally went into labour in the middle of the night .
the original plan had been for my mum to look after ruben while i went to hospital .
but when theo decided he was coming quickly , ruben was brilliant .
he ran to get the phone , brought towels - whatever we needed .
paramedics arrived to assist michelle with the last part of labour .
