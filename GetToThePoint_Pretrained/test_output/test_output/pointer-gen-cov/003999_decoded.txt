niamh geaney , a 26-year-old tv presenter from dublin , teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed twin strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days .
niamh found her match in karen branigan , 29 , a fellow ireland native who lives just an hour down the road , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together .
niamh said the pair got on ' very well ' as they both applied make-up before the shoot , swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities .
