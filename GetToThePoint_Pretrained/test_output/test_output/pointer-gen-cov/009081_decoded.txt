the german woman , who has not been named , was in a taxi which was stuck in traffic shortly after arriving at charles de gaulle airport on wednesday afternoon .
three thieves are said to have ‘ appeared from nowhere’ and smashed a rear window of the car , making off with the bag .
the items are all listed and numbered because of their high value – something which will make them very hard to sell on .
