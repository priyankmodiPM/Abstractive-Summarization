england 's riess nelson puts pressure on scotland 's jack adamson during the 2014 victory shield for under 16s has further worsened relations between the fa and the other home nations .
officials in scotland , wales and northern ireland were unhappy to find out about the fa ditching a tournament that started in 1925 via a letter from chairman greg dyke .
this is seen as another example of fa ‘arrogance’ following the english telling fifa that they want to send great britain football teams to the rio olympics .
