snp leader nicola sturgeon has left her boxy jackets and severe suits in the past - and she proved her new style credentials with a stunning appearance yesterday morning .
she looked svelte in the £179 knee-length 1940’s-style ‘blitz’ dress by edinburgh fashion label totty rocks , which was paired with a pair of raspberry stilettos .
miss sturgeon has been praised recently for her sartorial choices .
