ben stokes was involved in a war of words with west indies batsman marlon samuels last night after a hard-fought opening day of the second test .
the two clashed repeatedly on the pitch and samuels later taunted the durham all-rounder , saying : ' the english boys don’t learn ' as he found verbal alternations helpful while batting .
marlon samuels says the england players ' do n't learn ' because he has just come into cricket while i’ve been around for a while .
