fiona cullum , 25 , provided a safe haven for hassan hussain as he and fellow murderer yassin james , 20 , were hunted by police for gunning down sabrina moss in the street on a night out to celebrate her 24th birthday .
cullum then lied to officers when quizzed about hussain after he was arrested in 2013 over the murder in kilburn , north west london .
miss moss ' friend sabrina gachette , then 24 , was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn-off shotgun during the attack outside a bar .
