thibaud jean leon vallet , 24 , and his cousin jean mickael batrikian , 18 , pleaded guilty to animal cruelty after footage emerged of the pair lighting the quokka on fire with an aerosol can and a lighter on rottnest island on april 3 .
the pair appeared before fremantle magistrate 's court last friday and were ordered to pay $ 4000 and were told that they would be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fine .
animal rights activists have claimed that the pair 's punishment was too lenient for their crime .
