a group of students organized a anti-gay day protest at mcguffey high school in washington county encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing 'anti-gay ' on their hands .
the event was held last thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied by the so-called protesters .
thursday 's anti-gay day protest is understood to have been a reaction to the previous day 's event .
