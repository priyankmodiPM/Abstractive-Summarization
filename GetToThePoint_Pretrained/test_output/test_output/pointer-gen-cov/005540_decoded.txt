deputy prime minister said there was a ' very real danger ' that ukip and northern ireland 's dup could hold mr cameron to ' ransom ' in the event of a second hung parliament .
mr clegg 's remarks come after mr farage held out an olive branch to the prime minister last night as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible labour government .
mr clegg dropped his demand that the tories ditch mr cameron before any post election deal .
