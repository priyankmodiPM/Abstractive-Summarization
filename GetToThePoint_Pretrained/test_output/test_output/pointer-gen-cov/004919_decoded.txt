egypt 's former president has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 .
but a court in the country 's capital cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty .
defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions .
morsi , egypt 's first freely elected leader , came to power following the 2011 ouster of hosni mubarak in a popular uprising .
