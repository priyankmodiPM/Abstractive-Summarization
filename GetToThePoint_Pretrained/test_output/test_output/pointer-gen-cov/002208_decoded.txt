fifa vice-president jim boyce said on wednesday night that the sfa were ‘ entirely wrong’ in their move to ban josh meekings from the scottish cup final .
meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a leigh griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted celtic to write to the sfa seeking ‘ an understanding’ of why no penalty and red card followed .
meekings believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee steven mclean and his assistants .
