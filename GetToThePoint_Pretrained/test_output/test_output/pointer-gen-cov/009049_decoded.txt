sergio ramos was the first man carlo ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of real madrid’s dramatic champions league win over atletico madrid on wednesday .
ramos is one of those players for whom the old liverpool song about jamie carragher ‘ we all dream of a team of carraghers’ would be appropriate .
ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the santiago bernabeu for real madrid .
he started his real madrid career as a right back and won the european championship there for his country .
