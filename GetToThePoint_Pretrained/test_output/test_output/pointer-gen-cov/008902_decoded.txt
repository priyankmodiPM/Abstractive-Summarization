france 's biggest handball star nikola karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case .
karabatic , a multiple world and olympic gold medalist , and his younger brother luka were among a group of players banned by the french league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their montpellier club , which had already secured the title , lost to a struggling team .
karabatic 's lawyer michael corbier told sportsmail on wednesday the trial will likely take place within months .
