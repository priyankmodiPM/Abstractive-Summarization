stuart mccall on sunday night admitted the finest performance of his short ibrox reign left him with ‘goosebumps’ and a growing belief that he can steer revitalised rangers up to the premiership .
ibrox captain lee mcculloch publicly apologising for a reckless red card , first-half goals from kenny miller and haris vuckic were enough to ensure the captain’s 44th-minute folly did not prevent rangers securing an important three points against championship winners hearts .
genero zeefuik pulled back a late consolation for robbie neilson’s men but rangers closed out the game to make it three wins in a row .
