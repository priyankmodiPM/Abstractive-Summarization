victorino chua penned what he called a ‘ bitter nurse confession’ in which he spelled out ‘ how an angel can turn to an evil person’ .
chua is accused of killing three patients by contaminating their saline drips with insulin and deliberately poisoning 18 others at stepping hill hospital in stockport between 2011 and 2012 .
his lawyers say the document – found in his home following his arrest – is not a criminal confession but an ‘ outlet for his anger and frustration’ .
