ava ciach , from geelong in victoria , suffered from sagittal synostosis .
but it was n't until she took ava to a new doctor for a check-up that it was discovered two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely - restricting the growth of her brain .
ava , now six , had to undergo complex surgery in which she had her skull removed , smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle .
