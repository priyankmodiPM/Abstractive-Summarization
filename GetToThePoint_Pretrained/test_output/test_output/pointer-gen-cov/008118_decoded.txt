gary warren has called for a change to the ' ridiculous ' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons .
warren picked up his second booking of the competition in sunday 's scottish cup semi-final win over celtic .
but the central defender , who also missed last year 's league cup final for the same reason , says either the threshold should be raised .
warren knew instantly that he 'd miss the final when ref steven mclean rightly showed him a yellow card .
