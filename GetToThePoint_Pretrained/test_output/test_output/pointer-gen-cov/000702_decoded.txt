female sterilization is linked to the controversial `` eugenics '' movement .
some have claimed this practice `` evokes a dark corner of american history '' where the mentally ill or `` deficient '' were forced to undergo sterilization .
there is even a 1927 supreme court case , buck v. bell , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization was constitutional .
