sean dyche has attempted to protect out-of-sorts striker danny ings by calling on the rest of his team-mates to share the goalscoring burden to keep the team in the premier league .
ings , strongly linked with a move to manchester united or liverpool when his contract at turf moor runs out in the summer , has n't scored since february 11 — a run of eight matches — and missed his side 's best chance in saturday 's 1-0 defeat at everton that left burnley bottom .
as a team , they have scored just one goal in their last seven matches .
