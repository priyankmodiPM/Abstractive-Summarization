a finger-width tube called an endobronchial ultrasound ( ebus ) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and take a tissue sample in one go .
the procedure involves inserting the ebus down the throat , guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube .
an ultrasound scanner attached to one end of the tube takes a scan while a small needle takes a tissue sample .
