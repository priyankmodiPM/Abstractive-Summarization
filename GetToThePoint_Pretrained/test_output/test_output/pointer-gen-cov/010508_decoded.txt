falkirk booked their place in the scottish cup final with a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over hibernian at hampden park .
the dominant easter road side hit the post just before the break through fraser fyvie and again in the second half through fellow midfielder scott allan , with the bairns rarely threatening .
however , the hibees were stunned in the 74th minute when craig sibbald headed in a blair alston cross to set up a meeting on may 30 with either inverness or celtic .
