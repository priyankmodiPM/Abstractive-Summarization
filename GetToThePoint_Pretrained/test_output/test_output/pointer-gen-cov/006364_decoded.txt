scottish first minister nicola sturgeon scoffed at ed miliband’s attempts to rule out a post-election pact with the scottish national party last night as she said labour had no chance of winning a majority on its own .
mr miliband yesterday insisted he would not agree to a ‘ confidence and supply’ deal with the snp , who look set to deprive his party of an outright win and could hold the balance of power .
critics said that would mean a weak labour government having to negotiate day out with snp mps .
