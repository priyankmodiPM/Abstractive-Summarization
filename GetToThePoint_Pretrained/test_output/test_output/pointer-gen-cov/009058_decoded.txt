the mark 1 version of reginald mitchell 's famous design was among the first built in march 1940 , but spitfire p9374 never made it to the battle of britain as it crash-landed in may 1940 .
the fighter plane , dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies , was being piloted by flying officer peter cazenove over dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a german dornier bomber .
before it was lost , spitfire p9374 was at one point almost certainly flown by squadron leader roger bushell , later ' big x ' , who was part of the famous breakout from german prisoner of war camp stalag luft iii .
