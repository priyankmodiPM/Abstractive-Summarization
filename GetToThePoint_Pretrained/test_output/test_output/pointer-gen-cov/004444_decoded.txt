desert fairy circles are considered one of nature 's greatest mysteries .
they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter ( three metres to 20 metres ) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon , or big freckles .
several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings , and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass , zebras rolling in circles , competition for resources .
