president barack obama will be sending an administration official to armenia this week .
obama promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous armenian-american , kim kardashian , and the pope for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide .
but the white house still refuses to call the mass killings of ethnic armenians a ' genocide ' for fear of offending ally turkey .
