kim jong un has backed out of next month 's visit to moscow for world war ii anniversary celebrations .
the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the north korea in late 2011 .
kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments .
