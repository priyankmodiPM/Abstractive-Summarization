archaeologists have revealed 20 stone flakes and anvils - used to help shape the tools - just west of lake turkana in kenya .
the discovery could fundamentally change the current view of human evolution as - if correct - the date of the stone tools is 700,000 years older than any others found previously .
many experts have long believed that it was the use of stone tools by early species of homo like homo habilis and homo erectus that helped set them apart from other human-like species .
