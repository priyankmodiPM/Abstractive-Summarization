alissa sizemore , from vernal , utah , was only seven-years-old when a truck ran over her foot and immediately severed it .
she chose colbie caillat 's hit try , a song that she and her mom felt accurately reflected her emotional journey over the past year , for her debut performance , in which she removed her artificial limb as a part of her routine .
alissa 's mom heather proudly shared a video of her daughter 's performance last month on her youtube channel .
