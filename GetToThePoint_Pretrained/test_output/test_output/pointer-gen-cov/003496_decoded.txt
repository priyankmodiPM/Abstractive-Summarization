president barack obama would be willing to meet congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with iran if a senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon .
senators later voted 19-0 to give congress the authority to approve a final deal with iran that the white house earlier implied may have been on the chopping block .
it now goes to the full senate , where it is could pass with a veto-proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers .
