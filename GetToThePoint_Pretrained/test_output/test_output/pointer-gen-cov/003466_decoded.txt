ed miliband has been accused of stooping to a ' shameful ' new low by blaming david cameron for the mediterranean refugee crisis .
labour leader used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing north africa could have been avoided if the prime minister had done more following his intervention in libya to remove the former dictator .
it comes after mr cameron held emergency talks with eu leaders in brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis .
