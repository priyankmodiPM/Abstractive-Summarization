jade ruthven , 33 , was so upset by the ' poison pen ' note that she got her own back by forwarding it onto comedian em rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media .
the ' poison pen ' letter was sent to an ' baby spamming ' mother after the author got fed up with ' a few of the girls ' to say they are ' so over ' the running commentary .
the incredible printed letter , littered with expletives and exclamation marks , starts with the anonymous author saying they had got together with ' a few of the girls ' .
