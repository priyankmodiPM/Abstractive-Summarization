an artist 's illustration shows the symbolic red poppy design on the new $ 2 coin to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the gallipoli landing by the anzacs .
it has an image of poppies - symbolic of remembrance - among crosses similar to those that mark the graves of fallen soldiers , and the words ' lest we forget ' .
they will be in circulation from monday , but an artist 's impression of the coin clearly shows the craftsmanship involved .
