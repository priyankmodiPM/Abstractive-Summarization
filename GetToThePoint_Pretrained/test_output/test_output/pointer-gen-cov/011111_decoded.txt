lionel messi , neymar and luis suarez is a star-studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have , but when the going gets tough , barcelona turn to jeremy mathieu and gerard pique .
the french centre-back flung himself through the air to reach xavi 's free kick at the back post , heading home from close range , finally breaching celta vigo 's stern defence .
it was mathieu who had opened the scoring in the el clasico , in similar fashion .
celta vigo goalkeeper alvarez conde is unable to stop the powerful header from mathieu .
