president barack obama met for an hour saturday with his cuban counterpart raul castro .
the meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the americas came as the two countries work to end the cold war enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties .
castro , who earlier in the day said he trusted obama , acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks .
