scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old neanderthal teeth found in el sidron , spain .

dr sabrina krief , a lecturer at the national museum of natural history in paris , and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable .
