kevin sinfield 's 500th appearance for leeds as they completed a notable double over the super league leaders in emphatic fashion at headingley .
sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the rhinos against sheffield eagles at headingley in 1997 .
he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion , with the wolves running out 29-10 winners .
leeds had an early chance when prop adam cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all warrington .
