jos hooiveld 's late strike earned millwall a crucial 2-1 victory over south london rivals charlton on good friday - the lions ' first win at the den since october .
hooiveld prodded home magaye gueye 's low drive in the 87th minute , after gueye had cancelled out alou diarra 's strike for the addicks .
charlton had skipper chris solly dismissed midway through the first half for deliberate handball in the box , but stephen henderson saved lee gregory 's resulting penalty .
