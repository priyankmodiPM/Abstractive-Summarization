panasonic has developed a lighter , smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in .
uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the device , a 'high-pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air .
alternatively , the q has a '1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow .
