new metro line extension opened this week in the czech capital .
but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn’t have a moving staircase .
that means porters are left to carry travellers’ bags up and down the stairs at nadrazi veleslavin station , in north-west prague , from 5am to 10pm every day , free of charge .
