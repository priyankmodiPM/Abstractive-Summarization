experts fear millions of asian hornets could be heading to britain .
they pick off bees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted the hornets can move in and ransack it .
the hornet is thought to have travelled to france on some chinese pot plants in 2004 .
it has colonised huge swathes of the country and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in just a couple of hours , honey production has plummeted .
