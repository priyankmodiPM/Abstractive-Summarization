ethel rider , 87 , suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed at the half acre care home in radcliffe .
but even though the grandmother was in agony , her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed .
because she is mute , mrs rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened .
