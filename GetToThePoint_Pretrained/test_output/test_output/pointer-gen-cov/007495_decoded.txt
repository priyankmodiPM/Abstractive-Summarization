workers in china have been pictured building a walkway for tourists while perched thousands of feet up a mountain side in pingjiang county , hunan province .
builders are left standing on nothing more than rusty-looking scaffolding poles as they hammer them into the rock to extend the road further round the cliff .
pingjiang county is well-known for its mountains , with the mufu mountain range sweeping through most of the province .
