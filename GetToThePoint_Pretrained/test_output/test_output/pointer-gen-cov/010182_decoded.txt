shauna mcglasson , 25 , from workington , was so overweight she got trapped in the turnstiles at blackpool pleasure beach in august last year .
shauna , who was a takeaway addict , was carrying her three-year-old daughter lacey in her arms at the time and the toddler started screaming after her mother tried to free herself .
this was the final straw for the full-time mum who had been left battling depression and anxiety .
