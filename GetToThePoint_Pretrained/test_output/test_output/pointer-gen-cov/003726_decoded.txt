justin bettman caught the media 's attention a few months ago when he began his ' set in the street ' project .
bettman , sometimes with the help of designer gozde eker , would build sets that , in pictures , looked like the inside of a living room , child 's bedroom , or a bathroom complete with a clawfoot tub .
bettman said after he read the email there ' was n't even a question ' on whether he would say yes .
