nasa’s mars reconnaissance orbiter spotted its robotic companion on the surface of the red planet .
the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock .
but interestingly , the rover’s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the martian weather .
