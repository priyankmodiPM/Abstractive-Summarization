carl froch 's dream of a swansong fight in las vegas against julio cesar chavez jr looks to have gone up in smoke after the former middleweight world champion was stopped in nine rounds by andrzej fonfara .
the 37-year-old super-middleweight , who has not fought since knocking out george groves in their re-match at wembley last may , had hoped to be back in action last month against chavez but an elbow injury scuppered his plans .
chavez was knocked down in the ninth and although he managed to survive until the end of the round .
