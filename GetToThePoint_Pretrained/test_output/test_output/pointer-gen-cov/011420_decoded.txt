the sapling was planted in january-wabash park in ferguson , missouri on saturday as a dedication to the teenager , who was gunned down in the street by a police officer last august .
it was called ' a symbol of peace , comfort and hope for all who gather around its branches ' at a small ceremony led by the black caucus of the american library association , which donated the tree .
but by sunday morning , the tree had been ripped down , leaving just a shard of the trunk .
the metal dedication plaque at the base of the tree had also been removed .
