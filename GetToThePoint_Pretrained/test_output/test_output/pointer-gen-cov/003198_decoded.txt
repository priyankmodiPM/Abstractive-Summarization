two armed robbers have been caught on camera using a sledgehammer and an axe to try and smash their way into a jewellery shop .
the raiders were foiled by a brave employee who barricaded the door to the premises , and they proceeded to flee on a motorbike .
one of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at uncle jewellers and pawn brokers .
greater manchester police are now investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar break-in at another wigan jeweller last week .
