health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking .
the move would apply in pubs , clubs , supermarkets and off-licences in scotland .
if introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in scotland than it is in the rest of britain .
