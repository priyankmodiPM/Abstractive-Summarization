former premier league referee mark halsey has got to look at the appointment process for the fa cup final instead of mark clattenburg .
halsey said the english game would be a ‘ laughing stock’ over the decision to ignore clattenburg , one of only two english referees in the uefa elite ranks .
halsey thinks clattenburg , who has never refereed an fa cup final , has been overlooked as the professional game match officials board ( pgmo ) would prefer clattenburg to go to euro 2016 next summer .
