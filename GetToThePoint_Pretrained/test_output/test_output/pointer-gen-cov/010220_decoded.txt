world no 2 roger federer has been enjoying some downtime in the snow .
the 33-year-old provided the snap with a witty caption - ' tennice ' - and was wearing the scarf of fc basel , the football team he supports .
federer won the key biscayne event in 2005 and 2006 , but skipped it in 2013 also to lighten his workload .
