three men were part of a group of five divers from the east coast and san francisco .
witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough , choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby .
abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $ 70 per pound .
