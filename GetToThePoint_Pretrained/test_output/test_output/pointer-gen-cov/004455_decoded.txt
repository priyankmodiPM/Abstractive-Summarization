marie csaszar , 45 , died last september following a ten-year battle with a brain tumour .
she had worked for seven years at the bbc’s financial centre in cardiff as a contracts manager , but according to her husband paul , she was forced out of the post into another job after drawing attention to management blunders .
legal experts described the case as ‘ highly unusual’ , but predicted it could be followed by similar claims as digital documents such as emails and social media posts play an increasingly important part in people’s lives .
