clorox has apologized for a social media misstep after the company sparked outrage by tweeting ' where 's the bleach ' in reference to last week 's introduction of new ' emoji ' cartoons for iphones .
the maker of clorox bleach and other products says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emoji symbols for objects like toilets and bathtubs that people use bleach to clean .
but the corporate twitter post hit a nerve when news reports and online discussions were focusing on the new collection of racially diverse faces .
