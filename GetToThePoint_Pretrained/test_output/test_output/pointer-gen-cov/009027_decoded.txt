cody neatis , from preston , was admitted to royal preston hospital last thursday with a chest infection .
but rather than a bed in the children 's ward , has had to sleep on the floor as the hospital does n't have the special cot he needs to keep him safe in his sleep .
cody has down 's syndrome , epilepsy , autism and is fed by a tube .
