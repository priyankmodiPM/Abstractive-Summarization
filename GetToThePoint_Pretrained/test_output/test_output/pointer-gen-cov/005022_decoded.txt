louis van gaal blamed himself for manchester united 's game with 10 men .
the united boss said : ' it was of course an error from me that i give too much minutes to my substitutes .
it is not so wise .
it will come as little consolation to sergio aguero that he reached the 100-goal mark faster than any player in manchester cityâ€™s history ' .
