biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself .
they found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip .
the image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes .
