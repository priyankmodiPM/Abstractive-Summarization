married couple john and karen copleston claim paul phillips , 67 , had constantly harassed them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their Â£210,000 house in poole , dorset .
but on friday the case against mr phillips was dismissed , although a three-year restraining order was imposed on him under the protection from harassment act by magistrates in bournemouth .
the coplestons claim the gate has been at the end of the shared path since they bought the property in 1987 .
