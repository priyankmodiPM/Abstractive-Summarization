hundreds of thousands of people who bought british gas shares are in line for a windfall after their investment soared in value last night .
the shares are one of the most popular in the uk due to the hugely successful ‘ tell sid’ advertising campaign when british gas was privatised .
shares in what is now called the bg group rose by nearly 30 per cent to 1,153p .
