mark o'meara rolled back the years with one of the standout rounds of the day to make the cut at the masters for the first time in 10 years .
the 1998 champion was one over after the first round but five birdies in his second , including three in four holes on the front nine , saw him card a 68 on day two and ensured he will still be in the running at the weekend .
o'meara is the third oldest man in the field in 2015 , behind tom watson .
