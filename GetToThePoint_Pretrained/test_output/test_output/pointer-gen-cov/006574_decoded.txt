dave roberts , who is in the running to become the mayor of middlesbrough , followed in his great-great-uncle daniel mcallister 's footsteps by leaping off the transporter bridge over the river tees .
instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - mr roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children 's charity .
mr mcallister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in port clarence in a bet worth a sixpence .
