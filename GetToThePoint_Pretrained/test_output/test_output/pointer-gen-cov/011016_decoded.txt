felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at john f kennedy international airport .
the two-year-old grey tabby belongs to jennifer stewart , 31 , and her 34-year-old husband joseph naaman , who said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly – apparently while being transferred from the plane – that felix was able to get out and run away .
jennifer said she is n't satisfied with the way felix 's crate was secured and transported on the etihad airways flight .
