kansas has become the first state to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus .
the law bans the so-called ' dilation and evacuation ' procedure and redefines it as ' dismemberment abortion .
' sam brownback , the governor of kansas , tweeted a photo on tuesday showing him signing the abortion-ban bill into law .
brownback has presided over one of the nation 's most aggressive pushes to limit abortions , resulting in at least 20 laws restricting the practice of medically terminating pregnancies .
