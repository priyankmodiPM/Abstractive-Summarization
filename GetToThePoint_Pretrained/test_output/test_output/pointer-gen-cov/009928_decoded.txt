marla mccants , from nashville , tennessee , on last night 's season finale of my 600lb life , doctors determined that she was only months - maybe even weeks - from dying .
marla 's recovery seemed like a hopeless cause until it dawned on the mother-of-three that this was her last shot .
if she did n't get up , she would spend the rest of her very short life .
