parking attendant roberto cinti was driving the ferrari , when he mistook the throttle for the brake .
the car 's owner entrusted the car , which is one of the most powerful ever produced by ferrari , to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner .
however , instead of pressing the brake when approaching a shop front , the driver mashed the throttle , unleashing 671bhp from the magnificent 6.0-litre v12 engine , which ordinarily could propel the car to 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds .
