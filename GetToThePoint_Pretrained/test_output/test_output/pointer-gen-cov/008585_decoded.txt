tommy connolly had n't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on facebook out of the blue in december .
he messaged his 17-year-old cousin angela* ( name has been changed for legal reasons ) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless , illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant .
mr connolly said he did n't think twice about helping her .
