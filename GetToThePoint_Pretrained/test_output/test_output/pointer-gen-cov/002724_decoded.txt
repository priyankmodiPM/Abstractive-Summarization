ba van nguyen was able to fly a ch-47 chinook , the largest helicopter in the south vietnamese army .
he flew towards the uss kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land , and so he hoovered over as his family ( daughter circled in red ) safely jumped into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own .
