photos marking the 50th anniversary of new york city 's landmarks law look at the devastating architectural losses that led up to the law and how it has helped preserve beautiful old buildings .
the loss of the old penn station , which was built in the area now called soho in 1807 , was demolished in 1918 as the city moved to widen the street next to it .
the law was signed by mayor robert wagner on april 19 , 1965 , and upheld by the supreme court in 1978 .
