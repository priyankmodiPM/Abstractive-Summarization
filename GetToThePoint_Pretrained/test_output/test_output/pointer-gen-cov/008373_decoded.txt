rosetta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko .
the jet may have been caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface , causing an explosion of material .
but it is unusual , because so far such activity has only been spotted on the day-side of the comet - not the night , like this .
