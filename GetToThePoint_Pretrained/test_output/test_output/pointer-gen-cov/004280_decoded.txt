paris saint-germain manager laurent blanc admitted that barcelona were superior to his side ' in virtually every department ' as he saw his team slump to a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the quarter-final at the parc des princes .
an early strike from neymar and second-half brace from luis suarez sealed victory for barcelona and placed the catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the nou camp on tuesday .
blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended marco verratti and zlatan ibrahimovic .
psg were also unable to start with david luiz and saw thiago silva hobble off in the early stages .
