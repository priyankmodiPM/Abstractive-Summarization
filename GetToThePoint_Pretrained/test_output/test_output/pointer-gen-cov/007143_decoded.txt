susie clark found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field on thursday , her last day of a trip to the park with her husband .
clark named the pinto-bean-sized , teardrop-shaped gem a ' hallelujah diamond ' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something .
clark , who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother , prayed to god , asking , ' are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today ? ' as she searched the field .
