the Â£2,000 designer tote bag , hand-made in japan , was a 50th birthday gift for hampstead woman , sabine smouha , from her husband jeremy , the director of an investments company .
but when it arrived in britain in 2013 , customs officers confiscated it because nile crocodiles are a protected species and it did n't have the right documentation .
judge anne redston said the crocodile was farmed and mrs smouha had relied on the reputable japanese manufacturer to get the formalities right .
