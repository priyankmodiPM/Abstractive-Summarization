cristiano ronaldo will start for real madrid against eibar on saturday .
the portuguese was booked after being brought down by rayo defender antonio amaya inside the box , incurring a one-game suspension in the process .
but ronaldo is now free to start at the bernabeu after la liga 's appeals committee decided to appeal the yellow card for their star forward .
