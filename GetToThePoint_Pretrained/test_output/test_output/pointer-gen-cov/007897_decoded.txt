nick fisher , 31 , from leintwardine , shropshire , said his bedlington lurcher twiglet was left behaving strangely after accidentally eating a stash of drugs he found at a village bus stop .
the four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop .
but after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls twiglet seemed back to normal following his ' trip ' .
