heather hironimus , who filed the complaint late monday , is hoping a federal judge might intervene where state judges have n't .
the complaint is repeating her claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son is n't necessary , that the boy does n't want it , and that his constitutional rights are being violated .
hironimus and the boy 's father , dennis nebus , have been warring since her pregnancy .
