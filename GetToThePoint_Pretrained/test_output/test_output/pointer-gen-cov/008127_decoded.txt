josh darnbrough , 24 , slept , his mate rob gaskell , also 24 , inked the words ' if found face down call an ambulance ' on his back , using a diy kit .
josh tried to turn it into a cross , then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty , permanent mess on rob 's leg and causing his partner to go ' bonkers ' .
so when he saw josh passed out at the party , rob - who is a father of three - said he ' could n't resist ' the opportunity to execute revenge .
