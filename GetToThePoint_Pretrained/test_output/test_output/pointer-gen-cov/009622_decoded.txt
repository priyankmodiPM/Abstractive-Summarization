victoria wasteney , 38 , says she was branded a ‘ religious nutcase’ when she was suspended from her job as a senior occupational therapist , after her colleague enya nawaz , then aged 25 , accused her of trying to convert her to christianity .
her lawyers have now submitted a challenge to an employment tribunal , arguing that they broke the law by restricting her freedom of conscience and religion - enshrined in article nine of the european convention of human rights .
