jon hamm is pictured here in the university of texas at austin yearbook for 1990 ( left ) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the sigma nu fraternity .
the documents claim that hamm , 44 , was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic november 1990 initiation , but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom .
