louis jordan , 37 , was rescued 200 miles off the north carolina coast .
he said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean , and by catching rainwater in a bucket .
but doubters have questioned how jordan – with pale , unblemished skin – seemed in such good shape after such a gruelling ordeal .
