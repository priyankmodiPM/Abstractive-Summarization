former air hostess has won a £14.5m london mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90-year-old saudi arabian ex-husband .
the couple 's main marital home had been a £26m ' palatial residence ' in jeddah , saudi arabia , for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over .
but the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse , claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes .
