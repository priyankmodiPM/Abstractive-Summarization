the critically-panned film , which opened last year 's cannes film festival , will premiere on lifetime on memorial day , may 25 .
after the movie performed poorly in its international engagements , the weinstein co. , which first purchased u.s. distribution rights at the 2013 berlin film festival , decided to sell it directly to lifetime rather than book it into u.s. theaters .
