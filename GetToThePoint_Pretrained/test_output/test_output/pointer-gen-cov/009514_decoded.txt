the philadelphia office of transportation aims to get the city 's pedestrians off their phones by sending a man in bubble wrap out to spread their safety message .
a video from the office features characters in ' safety suits ' including bubbleman , a ' fashionista ' wrapped in the poppable material and a young man in flashing lights .
it is aimed at 18 to 25-year-olds who the campaign says are most likely to be hit by cars while on their phones .
