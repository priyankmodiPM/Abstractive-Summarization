paul tudor jones ii , the billionaire founder of tudor investment corporation , bought the casa apava estate in palm beach last week .
the mediterranean-style seven-bedroom property was built in 1918 and has 420 feet of oceanfront access .
the hefty purchase came days after jones warned that increasing inequality could spark a revolution as he gave a sold-out ted talk in canada in march .
