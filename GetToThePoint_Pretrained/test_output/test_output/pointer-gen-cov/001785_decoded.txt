tens of millions of people in china marked the ' tomb sweeping festival ' .
families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones , burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife .
huangdi is considered the ancestor of the qingming festival which sees the chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations .
