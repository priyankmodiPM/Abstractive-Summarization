around seven human skulls dating back nearly 2,000 years have far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the london crossrail site near liverpool street station .
when about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic river walbrook in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a roman cemetery to the north .
scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains , with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels .
