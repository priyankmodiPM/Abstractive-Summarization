ap mccoy will attempt to win the irish grand national on cantlow in his final race meeting in ireland .
the 19-time champion won the 2007 running on butler’s cabin and success aboard cantlow would be a fairytale start to what could be mccoy’s final week as a jockey .
he has vowed to immediately retire if he wins saturday’s crabbie’s grand national at aintree on favourite shutthefrontdoor , the gelding which won last year’s irish national under barry geraghty .
