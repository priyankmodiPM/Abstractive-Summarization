eight years ago , kaka knelt in the centre circle , spread his arms out wide , tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication .
the brazilian midfielder , who is deeply religious , was not mocked or ridiculed for the message on his clothes .
i ca n't remember anyone saying that such shows of religious devotion were out of place at a football match .
