italian authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of murdering the christians at sea .
the boat was intercepted by an italian navy vessel , which transferred the passengers to a panamanian-flagged ship .
other people on the voyage told police they were spared `` because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain '' .
