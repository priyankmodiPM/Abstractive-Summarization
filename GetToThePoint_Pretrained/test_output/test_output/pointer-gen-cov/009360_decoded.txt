the 100 tonne crane barge is being used to lift shopping trolleys and cars that have been dumped at the bottom of the river .
divers had already located and harnessed the dumped items before the barge was used by thousands of holidaymakers each year .
it came after the abandoned cars and other objects were identified by the environment agency during a recent survey of flood defences in bath .
