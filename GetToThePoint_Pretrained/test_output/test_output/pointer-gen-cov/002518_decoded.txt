christian refugees have revealed how they linked arms to form a ' human chain ' in a desperate bid to stop muslim migrants throwing them into the mediterranean sea .
survivors from the boat , made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities , have now claimed the men tried to throw other christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain .
