a video taken from the point of view of a train driver captures a ride on the highest railway in europe , the jungfrau .
the time lapse footage speeds along the 9km long electrified track , which leads from kleine scheidegg to jungraujoch and stands at an elevation of 2061m and 3454m respectively .
the train turns right to enter another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers .
