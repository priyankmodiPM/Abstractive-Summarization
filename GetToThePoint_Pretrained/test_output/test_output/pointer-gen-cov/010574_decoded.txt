kevin carr , 34 , from woolacombe , devon , has become the fastest man to run around the world despite being attacked by bears , hunted by packs of wild dogs , and run over twice .
he began his epic voyage at haytor on dartmoor in july 2013 and returned yesterday after 621 days , beating the previous record by a day .
mr carr was also the first man to complete the gruelling endurance run unsupported , and instead of a team carrying his equipment , he pushed it along himself in a buggy .
