jose mourinho might have called it poetic justice as ashley barnes was sent off on the stroke of half-time to deliver a major blow to burnley 's prospects of staying in the premier league .
burnley were left feeling hard-done-by as referee mike jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed kevin mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything barnes did .
all that would be called karma in mourinho 's book .
