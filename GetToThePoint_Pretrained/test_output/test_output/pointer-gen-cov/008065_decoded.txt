malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for islamic state extremists in the country .
the prevention of terrorism act passed in the capital kuala lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial .
but it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire .
human rights watch described it as ' a giant step backwards for human rights ' .
