president tomislav nikolic described being ' thrown around the cabin ' when a plane taking him to italy last week began tumbling through the air on friday .
the plane landed safely back in belgrade , but nikolic was forced to cancel his official visit to meet pope francis in the vatican , and his advisers put the incident down to yet another malfunction on the ageing , incident-prone aircraft .
one adviser told reuters that she would ' never step foot on that plane again , ' saying the fall had lasted ' for what seemed like an eternity ' .
