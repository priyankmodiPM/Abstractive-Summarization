me-bai , the old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true , based on a touching video showing an asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart .
it is particularly sad because females tend to stick together in herds until they die , sharing incredibly strong bonds .
they are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age .
