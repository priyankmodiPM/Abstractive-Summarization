samsung famously poked fun at apple when it emerged its iphone 6 plus could bend out of shape in people 's pockets .
the company has now responded with its own video , demonstrating a three-point bend test on both its galaxy s6 models .
the video was released by third-party warranty firm squaretrade , and has since been criticised by samsung .
