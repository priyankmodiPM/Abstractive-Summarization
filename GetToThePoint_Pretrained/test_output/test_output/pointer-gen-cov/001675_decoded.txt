a lithuanian talk show has accused norway of stealing their children .
the episode of an hour with ruta claimed that foreign children were being seized and fostered with norwegian parents to strengthen the nordic country 's ' genetic material ' .
an introduction to the chat show argued that norway 's child protection service argued that it was deliberately targeting lithuanian children which were seen as a 'sought-after commodity ' .
earlier this year , lithuania 's gražina leščinskiene hit local headlines after her son gabrieliaus was taken into care by norway 's child protection service .
