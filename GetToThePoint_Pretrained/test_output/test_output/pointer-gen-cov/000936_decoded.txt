martial law was lifted wednesday when the thai king bhumibol adulyadej approved a request from prime minister general prayuth chan-ocha to proceed .
critics have expressed alarm at the move , with human rights watch 's asia director brad adams saying it marked the country 's `` deepening descent into dictatorship '' .
prayuth -- head of the national council for peace and order ( ncpo ) junta , immediately invoked article 44 of the country 's interim constitution .
