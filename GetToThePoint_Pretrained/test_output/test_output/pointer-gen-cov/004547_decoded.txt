scientists may have captured the song of a new species of whale living in the antarctic .
the song can’t be identified and doesn’t fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale .
experts sure the noise isn’t made by arnoux 's beaked whales or cuvier 's beaked whales , meaning that it could be coming from a completely new species .
