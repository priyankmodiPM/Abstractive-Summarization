nbc 's committee investigating the alleged misrepresentation of reporting experiences made by brian williams ( left ) are looking at tales he 's told about the tahrir square anti-government uprising in early 2011 .
the anchor said he caught the eye of the mounted soldier before he turned a corner and used a whip to begin ' beating human beings ' .
however , there is no footage of williams actually on the square during what he called the moment demonstrations ' turned sour ' and descended into violence .
