grey and white cat marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner brendon veale 's garage and his neighbours in hanham , bristol .
rspca were called and they too were unable to coax the pet from the gap and eventually firefighters had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free .
