researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on mars .
the ‘ hidden valley’ in gale crater on mars is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet .
when night falls , calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid .
curiosity landed on mars in 2012 in the large crater , gale , located just south of the equator .
