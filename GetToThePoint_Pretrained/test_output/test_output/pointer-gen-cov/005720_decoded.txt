dr frederic brandt , who killed himself a week ago , said a tv show that parodied his appearance was partly to blame for his death .
many believed that he was ' hurt ' by the show and it was a factor in the 65 year old 's decision to take his own life .
fredric was a dear friend but he was also very vain and to be parodied this way must have hurt .
