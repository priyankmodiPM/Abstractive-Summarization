ander herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in manchester united 's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal .
in fact , six of herrera 's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition 's net .
herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as he struck an impressive first-time shot against yeovil in the third round of the fa cup back in january .
