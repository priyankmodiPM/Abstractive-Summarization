gerry sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the bradford city fire in 1985 claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster .
a new book claims that the fire at valley parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman stafford heginbotham , who died in 1995 .
the judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand .
