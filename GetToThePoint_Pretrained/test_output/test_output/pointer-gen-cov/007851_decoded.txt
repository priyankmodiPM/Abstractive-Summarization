the sandy-colored canine was found sprawled in a pool of his own blood on a rural road in cass county , north dakota .
the animal , who has been named wilford by his rescuers , needed more than 50 stitches after being set upon with an eight inch blade .
wilford has been nursed back to health by a foster family and is now slowly returning to his paws .
