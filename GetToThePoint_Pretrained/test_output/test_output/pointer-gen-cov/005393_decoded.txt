kyle toth , who runs his own custom woodworking business , built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in temecula .
it measures a whopping 45ft in length , and was trying to drop this tree in between two others .
kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides .
