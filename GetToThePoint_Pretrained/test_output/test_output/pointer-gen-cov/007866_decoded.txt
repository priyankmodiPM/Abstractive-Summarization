malachi irving-elkins felt a few contractions on thursday morning but thought she had enough time to run a few last errands before the arrival of her baby .
she was in the stanley mosk courthouse in los angeles to pay a fine on thursday when she suddenly knew he was coming - and there was no way she 'd make it to hospital in time .
clerks rushed to her side and alerted officers from the los angeles county sheriff 's department .
