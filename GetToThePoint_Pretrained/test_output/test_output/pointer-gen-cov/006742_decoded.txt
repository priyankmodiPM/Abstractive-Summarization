riddick bowe , of maryland , has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $ 20 .
he recently offered to ' tweet anything ' for people who credit him through paypal , sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers .
his offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat evander holyfield .
