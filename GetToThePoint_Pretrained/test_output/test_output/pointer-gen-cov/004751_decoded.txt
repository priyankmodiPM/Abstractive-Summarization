sally jones , 45 , once played in a female punk band , ran away from her home in chatham , kent , to wage jihad with her toyboy husband in raqqa , syria .
a video has now emerged which appears to show the mother-of-two leading members of the al-khanssaa brigade - the all-women contingent set up by isis - in a series of chants expressing the fighters ' commitment to jihad .
experts say the slicky-edited video is the first ' real evidence ' which shows jones is involved with the brigade at a ' high level ' .
