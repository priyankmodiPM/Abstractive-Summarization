claudia martins , 33 , wept as she walked free after a judge accepted she had a ' momentary abnormality of mental functioning ' which she no longer suffered from a condition known as a ' pathological denial of pregnancy ' .
she ' intended ' to dispose of the tragic baby 's body unnoticed , wrapping it in a plastic bag and towels , but was prevented from doing so when paramedics arrived and whisked her off to hospital .
until that point she had managed to keep her pregnancy secret from her family and gave birth to the child .
