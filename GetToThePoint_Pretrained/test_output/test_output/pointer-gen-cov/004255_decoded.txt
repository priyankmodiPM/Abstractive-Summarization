hannah brierley thought her mother was playing a prank when she spotted the six foot-long northern pine snake on a bath mat which was hung up to dry at her home in rochdale , manchester .
she stared at the reptile for a few minutes until it moved and quickly called for her 40-year-old mother , karen marriott , to come upstairs .
mrs marriott attempted to call the rscpa at 7am morning but after she was unable to get through she panicked and dialled 999 .
