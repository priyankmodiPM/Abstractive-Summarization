rosemary taylor , communications director of the city of brookhaven in georgia , made the ' racist ' remark to hired photographer nelson jones at the local cherry blossom festival two weeks ago .
after witnessing mr jones capture a test shot of models dominique jackson , 18 , and 19-year-old khamlee vongvone at the event , she apparently went over to him and referenced the two girls .
she reportedly told him : ' this is not the image i want for the city of brookhaven ' .
