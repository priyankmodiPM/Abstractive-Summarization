forecasters say more severe weather could form as far away as the plains of west texas .
fewer than 1 million people were in wednesday 's ' moderate risk ' area between wichita , kansas , and jefferson city , missouri , but 34 million were under at least a slight risk of seeing damaging winds , large hail and possibly a tornado .
kansas officials warned that hail could be the size of baseballs , while illinois officials told residents they should be prepared to seek shelter if bad weather arrives .
