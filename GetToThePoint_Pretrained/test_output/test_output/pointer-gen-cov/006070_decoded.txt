greg dyke has vowed there will be no repeat of the fa’s failure to deliver potentially life-saving research into links between concussion and early on-set dementia .
the fa and pfa promised a 10-year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on-set dementia after a coroner found astle’s brain ‘ resembled a boxer’s’ but a mail on sunday investigation was never carried out .
dyke went to the hawthorns on saturday for the launch of the jeff astle foundation .
