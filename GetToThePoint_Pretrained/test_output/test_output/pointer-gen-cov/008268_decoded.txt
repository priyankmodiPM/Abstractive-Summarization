everton manager roberto martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after ross barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against burnley at goodison park .
the untried barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by david jones on aaron lennon – rather than leighton baines , who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the premier league .
barkley 's effort is saved by burnley goalkeeper tom heaton at goodison park .
