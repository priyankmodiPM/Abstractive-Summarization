historic building repairer gregg olson and architectural historian pam hayden have been analyzing the log cabin for seven years and say it is unlike anything else found in oregon .
the way the logs are tightly interwoven , secured without nails and leaving no gaps to fill , is similar to russian log cabins of the same time period .
olson and hayden are currently trying to find a permanent place to house the cabin .
