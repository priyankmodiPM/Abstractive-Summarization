the intruders broke into a home in hatfield peverel , essex , flooded the kitchen , dumped the tv in a bath filled with water and slashed sofas and chairs in a wanton wrecking spree .
they stole jewellery including a wedding ring and watches , a computer , laptop and tablet from the house and left thousands of pounds in damage .
there seems to be no method to the ransacking of the property , with cupboards open at random and emptied on to the floor .
