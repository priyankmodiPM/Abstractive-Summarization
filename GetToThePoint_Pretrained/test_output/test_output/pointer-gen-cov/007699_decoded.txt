stasi - the ' stasi ' during the 40 year existence of the east german state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as ' evidence ' .
they were also thought to have been used for training purposes for border guards and trainee agents intended to inculcate in them awareness of the lengths people would go to in order to try to escape the confines of east germany .
but photographer arwed messmer , who discovered the pictures , sees another reason for the pictures , showing exactly how they had planned to escape from the german democratic republic .
