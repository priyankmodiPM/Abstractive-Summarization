rory mcilroy believes it is ' unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances .
