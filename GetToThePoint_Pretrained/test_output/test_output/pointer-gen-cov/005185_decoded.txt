hannah overton , 37 , wiped back tears as she , along with her husband larry and five children , celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son , andrew burd , with an overdose of salt , prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case .
her family stood by her and protested her innocence , but nueces county district attorney mark skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges .
he could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel , meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy .
