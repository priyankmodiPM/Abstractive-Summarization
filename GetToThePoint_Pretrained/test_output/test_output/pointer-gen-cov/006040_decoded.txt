a freight train carrying a dangerous form of ammonia derailed in a rural area of trenton , south carolina on friday night , causing several cars to overturn and leak .
the train was traveling through salters pond road and highway 121 , near trenton , shortly after 8.30pm when it derailed after apparently hitting a tree that had fallen onto the tracks .
it was also transporting non-hazardous ammonia - a highly toxic , nitrogen-based chemical that can form explosive mixtures with air .
however , it is unclear whether the affected cars were the ones holding the dangerous anhydrous ammonia .
