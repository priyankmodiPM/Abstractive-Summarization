hannah moore , 20 , of broxburn in west lothian , had suffered stretchmarks after having twins , and had posted the images in a bid to boost her confidence .
but two minutes later , the mum of twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate ' nudity and violence ' .
hannah says the blocking of her account has made her think her body is ' clearly fat , ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick ' .
