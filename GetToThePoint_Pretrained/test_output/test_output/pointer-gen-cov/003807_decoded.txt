louis jordan , 37 , was picked up by a german-flagged ship at 1:30 p.m. on thursday - 66 days after he took off to do some fishing .
he was found sitting on the capsized hull of his sailboat , angel , which had lost its mast and was approximately 200 miles east of cape hatteras .
jordan 's family said he sailed out of a marina in conway , south carolina , on january 23 , and had n't been heard from since until a german boat saw him clinging to the hull of his boat .
he survived his ordeal by drinking rain water and eating raw fish and flour fried in oil .
