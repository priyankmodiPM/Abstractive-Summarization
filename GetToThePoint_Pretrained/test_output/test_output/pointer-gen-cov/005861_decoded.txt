tottenham manager mauricio pochettino has likened england hot-shot harry kane to gabriel batistuta and insisted he will be there to help him when things are not going to plan .
kane moved to within two strikes of the 30-goal barrier for the season after scoring on his full international debut some 79 seconds after coming on against lithuania at wembley last friday night .
england boss roy hodgson is mindful of keeping expectations in check for kane , who has enjoyed a meteoric rise .
