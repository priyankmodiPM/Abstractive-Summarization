blackpool chairman karl oyston took a surprising step in denying five football association charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a ‘retard’ . the unpopular chief initially had until march 30 to reply , but was granted an extension . his appeal is expected to be heard by a separate fa panel next month and oyston still faces a ban from football activities . blackpool chairman karl oyston has decided to contest his fa charge for allegedly abusive text messages . oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the seasiders’ worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour fa education course . the shocking text messages , seen by sportsmail , emerged just before christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan stephen smith , who he told to ' enjoy the rest of your special needs day out ' . oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange , and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy . the development comes just days after pensioner frank knight , a lifelong fan , was ordered to pay £20,000 in damages for alleged defamatory remarks made on his facebook page . the footballing world rallied around knight , with a kickstarter fund amassing the thousands he needed to pay . on announcing oyston’s denial , an fa statement read : ‘ it is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of fa rules , and that during the text message exchange , mr oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of blackpool fc . ‘ it is further alleged that each of these five breaches of fa rule e3 ( 1 ) is an ‘ aggravated breach’ as defined in rule e3 ( 2 ) , as each included a reference to disability . ‘ mr oyston has denied the charge . ’ it is not the only example of foul-mouthed exchanges to have happened in a bitter campaign . the oystons are extremely unpopular at the club , and fans have been protesting against their ownership . in a another rant from oyston , who also had abuse hurled at him , said : ' stop texting f****** , you should n't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football . get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium . ' you are banned because i think you are a p**** . ' impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you . ' oyston also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see blackpool , a premier league side four years ago , spiral down to the conference , with another text reading : ' i am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission ' . their relegation to league one was confirmed early last week and they are on course to tally the lowest number of points ever in the modern day second tier . there is to be a mass demonstration against their despised reign prior to the final game of the season against huddersfield next saturday . the content of the vile messages first emerged just before christmas and oyston came in for widespread condemnation . anti-discrimination group kick it out registered their disgust , with local paper the blackpool gazette scrapping the chairman’s weekly column with immediate effect . supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games . blackpool’s off-field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases , one involving a national newspaper . their lengthy statement on tuesday read : ‘ reluctantly , the company has been compelled to take action against a number of individuals and organisations following online postings or articles that contained vile lies and abuse about the club , its directors and players . to date , three settlements have been agreed with several further cases pending against other individuals and a national newspaper . ‘ any payments from court or agreed settlements will be anonymously distributed to fylde and north west based charities . the rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations , as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading , vibrant and forward thinking charity in blackpool , fylde and wyre . ‘ the latest settlement of £20,000 will be paid over four years in equal installments , with the charities set to benefit as and when the money is received by the club . ‘ for the avoidance of doubt , the club , directors , management staff and players would far prefer not to take any defamation action against any individual or organisation , but must continue to take action where necessary to combat the false , misleading stories and lies that are being perpetuated . ’
