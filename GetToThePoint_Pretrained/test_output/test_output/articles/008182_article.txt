a french bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for roma passengers - because the ' unbearable ' smell is a health risk to everyone on board . dominique granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of montpellier , in the south of france . but while his comments were immediately met with horror by some , the bus company tam has taken his comments seriously and is said to have ' outsourced ' part of the route . odour : the smell on route 9 in montpellier is said to be ' unbearable ' and caused by roma using the service . bus driver mr granier said the smell which accompanied the roma was a ' sanitation risk ' in an interview last week . speaking to the gazette de montpelier mr granier said : ' it is a true infection . ' his claims were backed up by other drivers , one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour . bernard gotis , a local union representative , was disgusted by the comments . ' we should not tackle the poor , but poverty ... we do not want to recreate apartheid in montpellier , ' he said . apartheid : some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp . pictured : roma in montpellier . however , mr gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion , and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell . he told french newspaper lib√©ration : ' our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with roma and to outsource this portion of line . ' the mailonline has contacted montpellier 's bus service for a comment .
