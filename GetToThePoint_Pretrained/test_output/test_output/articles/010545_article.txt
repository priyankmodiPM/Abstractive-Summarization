' it is common in romania for them not to use a euthanasia injection , but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart , strangling , clubbing to death . ' the founders of k-9 angels describe the pounds as ' filthy , dirty , short on food ' and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public ' . here , the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly . despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to , the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the angels ' affection when they are eventually rescued . animal charity four paws - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced . its spokesperson adam rahman told mailonline : ' dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment , and are essentially waiting to be killed . ' the organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in bucharest alone since the legislation was passed , and overseen the killing of around 16,000 .

' this is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that , although the killing law has been repealed since june 20 , 2014 , ' four paws said . the cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a world health organisation report claimed : ' in none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method ( catching , shooting or other ) have any significant long-term effect on dog population size . ' the k-9 angels were forged when tv wildlife presenter anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of romania on facebook . it was the plight of that dog - named angel - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in november 2011 . their petition to calling on the european union to investigate the ' disappearance ' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures . gruesome : charity four paws discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern romanian town . grotesque : while another charity dog rescue romani claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads . a rescue worker with dog rescue romani said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south-west of romania . its spokesperson marius costache told mailonline : ' the scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile . ' we asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left . ' we called our local police right at that moment and the answer was ' so what do you want us to do ? ' ' with the euthanasia law or without , it the slaughter in romania public shelters or streets will continue . ' between march and may 2014 , a team of investigators from four paws investigated 43 public shelters in romania â€“ from around 81 currently registered with the romanian vet authorities . the results of the investigation were shocking as they found that not one of these public shelters in romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs .
