' dallas police falsely reported talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last june during an nfl camp afterparty , the denver post reported . the police apologized after it ended up being yaqub who was arrested . during the 2011 incident in garland , felony warrants were issued for talib and his mother okolo talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon . police suspected them both of firing shots from a ruger .380 handgun at shannon billings , the boyfriend of talib 's sister , and also believed the nfl back attempted to pistol-whip billings with a springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident , the boston globe reported . they had apparently learned billings was being physically abusive towards their family member . talib , who owned both weapons . reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping : ' you 're going to make me throw away my career . ' the charges were dropped because prosecutors believed billings , a registered sex offender with the state of texas , would not make a credible witness . garland police spokesman joe harn said : ' it was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously . ' there was n't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting . ' after the 2011 incident , a felony warrant was issued for okolo talib for an assault with a deadly weapon charge . in addition to playing for the broncos , talib has also played for the new england patriots and tampa bay bucs . in addition to the gun incidents , talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a florida cab driver . he then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery . the shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the nfl 's policy on performance-enhancing substances . talib signed a six-year , $ 57 million contract with denver in march 2014 . he also has played for the new england patriots during his seven-year career . during his time with the reigning super bowl champs , talib said : ' i 'm a competitor on the field , man . ' that 's kind of what we 're talking about right now , just football . ' if charges are brought with regard to the incident in dallas , talib could face discipline under the nfl 's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history . talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a florida cab driver and resisted arrest on a battery charge .
