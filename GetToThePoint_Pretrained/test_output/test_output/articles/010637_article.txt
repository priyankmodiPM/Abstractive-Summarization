' ) and the new york stock exchange ( ' have a look at the facade and side entrance and move along ' ) . brad and jill are deeply passionate about travelling the world and say they go on holiday ' as much as humanly possible ' . writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for brad , with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete . but brad has handed out plenty of five-star ratings for everything from london 's tower bridge and the smithsonian american art museum in washington , dc to the berlin philharmonic and budapest 's liberty bridge . and no destination or cafe is off-limits . he has written reviews for a nando 's in london , a starbucks in hong kong and a mcdonald 's in dubai , which he gave a ' poor ' rating , writing that his sausage egg mcmuffin was ' quite poor in food quality , even by mcdonald’s international standards ' . brad joined tripadvisor in 2009 , but didn’t write his first review until 2010 when he and jill , a doctor , were touring saint petersburg , russia and were motivated to write a positive review after eating a ‘delicious’ slice of cheesecake at a restaurant . despite devoting countless hours to his reviews he hasn’t developed any fatigue . he said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible , but isn’t afraid to give a one-star rating if the hotel , restaurant or attraction wasn’t up to snuff . he also doesn’t regret any of the things he has written , adding : ‘ we don’t do a lot of cheerleading and we try to keep the emotions out of the reviews . brad estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on the couple 's recent two-week holiday in italy . brad and his wife , jill , have travelled to exotic destinations around the world , including rice terraces outside sagada , philippines . ‘ when i write a review i try to be more objective and informative and highlight the things that will be more important to the people who will visit . ‘ there are times when things fail to meet the expectations i might have of them but i don’t tend to slam them unless it’s a very , very bad experience . ’ this spring the couple toured italy , stopping in rome , florence and venice during their two-week holiday . brad , who has visited about 80 countries and has lived in hong kong for nine years , estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on their experiences at hotels , restaurants , museums , churches and piazzas in italy . despite devoting countless hours to his reviews brad is n't fatigued ; he said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible . the number of reviews he writes ultimately depends on the destination . if it’s a big city , he will likely have dozens of places to write about . but when they visited a game reserve in south africa the review count was low . brad doesn’t pay much attention to the word count , as the length of each review varies . he said : ‘ if it’s a museum like the british museum it’s going to be longer with tips and advice for other visitors . if we’re visiting a small pizzeria in rome the review won’t be so long . ’ brad reynolds said he used to spend a lot of time writing about his travels in journals , but now writes reviews to preserve his memories .
