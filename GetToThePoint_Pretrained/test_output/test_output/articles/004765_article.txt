real madrid failed to activate their first option on javier hernandez as the deadline passed on thursday night . the midnight deadline went by without madrid making a formal offer to buy the manchester united striker outright and they must now take their chances with other suitors if they wish to sign him . hernandez , 26 , has impressed in the last few weeks with five goals in his last six games including the decisive strike against atletico madrid in the champions league quarter final and two goals in madrid 's 4-2 win at celta vigo last sunday . javier hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at real madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . hernandez ( centre ) returned to training with his real madrid team-mates on tuesday . hernandez ( second left ) was all smiles in training , but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . yet it has followed a largely frustrating season where he has been restricted to just nine starts . united agreed a deal worth around £15million last summer which allowed real madrid to first loan hernandez for the season then buy him outright before other clubs could bid . that exclusivity period passed at midnight though and that will open the door for other clubs to bid . the mexico international has interest from west ham , southampton , newcastle and lazio among others and united value him at around £10million .
