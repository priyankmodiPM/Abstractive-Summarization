in the heart of yellowstone national park , a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day . but the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels , so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years . now , by tracking seismic waves , a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that 's so large its partly-molten rock could fill the grand canyon 11 times over . scroll down for video . a supervolcano in yellowstone national park ( pictured ) releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day . a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground . the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world . silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica . it is situated in yellowstone national park - which spans the midwestern us states of wyoming , idaho and montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago . the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world . it is situated in yellowstone national park - which spans the midwestern us states of wyoming , idaho and montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago . although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago , the researchers said . experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site . previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km ) . to discover the latest chamber , hsin-hua huang from the university of utah and colleagues tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes . the researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock . the remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption . it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) . lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago , researchers added . experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site . previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km ) . to discover the latest chamber , hsin-hua huang from the university of utah and his colleagues tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes . these readings combined data from the university of utah seismograph stations , which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in utah , idaho , the teton range and yellowstone , and from the earthscope array , which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield . each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano . the movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath . the researchers said in their paper : ' the yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust ' , published in the journal science , that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock . the remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption , they added . it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) . to put this into perspective , the grand canyon in arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles ( 4,168 cubic km ) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two-and-a-half times , and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times . previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir , beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km ) . the latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) ( illustrated ) . to discover the large chamber ( shown in yellow ) , the university of utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes . each of these quakes created waves that ' echoed ' around the supervolcano . the smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano 's caldera . researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago . if yellowstone did erupt , estimates from a national geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly . a 10-foot ( 3 metre ) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles ( 1,610km ) , leaving two-thirds of the us uninhabitable . this spread of volcanic ash , rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe . not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide , researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot-spot plume in earth 's mantle . it could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes . ' an understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk , ' said the researchers . ' this lower-crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper-crustal magma reservoir [ and ] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of co2 discharge . ' the presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations , but not detected . the paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago . the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world . researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago . yellowstone national park spans the midwestern us states of wyoming , idaho and montana ( pictured ) . if yellowstone did erupt , estimates from national geographic suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly . a 10-foot ( 3 metre ) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles ( 1,610km ) , leaving two-thirds of the us uninhabitable . this spread of volcanic ash , rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe . ' the magma chamber and reservoir are not getting any bigger than they have been , it 's just that we can see them better now using new techniques , ' added co-author jamie farrell , a post-doctoral researcher at the university of utah . for comparison , the grand canyon in arizona ( pictured ) has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles ( 4,168 cubic km ) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber of yellowstone would fill it two-and-a-half times , and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times . if yellowstone ( pictured ) erupted , estimates suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly . a 10-foot ( 3 metre ) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles ( 1,610km ) , leaving two-thirds of the us uninhabitable . and this spread of volcanic ash , rocks and gas would then disrupt air travel around the globe .
