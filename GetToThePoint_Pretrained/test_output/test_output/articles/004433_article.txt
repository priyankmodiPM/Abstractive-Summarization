' sometimes it feels like really severe stomach cramps , but i also get really bad stabbing pains that wo n't go away . ' i get no enjoyment out of food anymore . eating feels like a chore because i know it 's going to cause me pain . ' it seems pointless to make a healthy meal because i 'll just throw it up . ' with strong painkillers i can cope , but it feels like a curse - i 'm going to have to take this medication for the rest of my life . ' miss harris was a happy and healthy child but her weight began to increase through her teens despite making no change to her diet . miss harris says her ' dream body ' is actually a nightmare as she can not eat and vomits daily . by the age of 14 , she was dubbed ' fatty bum bum ' by playground bullies . she said : ' i ate whatever mum gave me , which was healthy because she was always watching her weight . ' as my waistline expanded , my confidence shrank and it was n't until i left school - and the bullies - behind me that i stopped worrying about my size . ' at college , i ate what i wanted and although i reached nearly 28 stone , i still made an effort with my clothes , hair and make-up . fat did n't have to mean ugly . ' with the humiliation of her school days behind her , miss harris gradually started to embrace her size 32 frame . but then shortly after her 17th birthday , having finally made peace with being overweight , she fell seriously ill . she said : ' i started vomiting 10 times a day . i just could n't keep anything down . ' within 20 months i 'd lost more than 18st . it did n't make any sense to me and i was terrified . ' concerned by the rapid and unprompted weight loss , she consulted her gp . in june 2014 , after months of tests , her doctor diagnosed her with crohn 's disease , a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system . there is currently no cure for crohn 's disease - treatment simply aims to relieve the symptoms of the digestive system becoming inflamed . miss harris was immediately prescribed a cocktail of pills , which she is required to take every day . she said : ' on a good day i have to take up to 70 pills , but it can go up to 100 on a bad one . ' the weight kept falling off until i reached size six . people congratulated me on the weight loss and told me i looked fabulous â€“ but the truth was i 'd never felt worse ' . she now weighs 8st 9lbs , which means she is very slim for her 5tf 7in height . she said : ' i 'll never be big again . i can only keep down around 10 per cent of what i eat , and right now i 'm even struggling to keep down water . ' before the sickness started , miss harris would tuck into a healthy bowl of cereal for breakfast . before being diagnosed with crohn 's disease , miss harris had four jobs . now , she is so tired she can not work . she said : ' i know it sounds unbelievable , but i 'd give anything to be 27 stone again ' . for lunch she 'd have a salad or a sandwich , and dinner was a meal cooked by her mother , such as a healthy portion of spaghetti bolognese made with reduced fat quorn mince . now , her condition means she can not eat fats or oils . she has not eaten junk food for the past three years and has been on a strict diet of boiled meat and vegetables . she said : ' i know it sounds unbelievable , but i 'd give anything to be 27 stone again . this time last year i held down four jobs , but now i 'm too ill to work . ' being curvy is part of what it means to be a girl . i had that before , but now i just look like a boy . ' ' my fingernails have been known to drop off because i 'm not getting any nutrients . ' i 've also suffered really badly with hair loss . i wore a wig for the entire summer of 2013 , which was hot , itchy and just generally uncomfortable . ' i even lost my eyebrows , which made me look like an alien . ' i ca n't go out and eat with my mates because i 'll be sick . ' in the past when i 've lost weight on purpose and people complimented me , i felt proud . now , when people say `` well done '' , i feel nothing . ' alarmingly , her weight is still decreasing and doctors are still baffled as to why her weight has not stabilised . she said : ' there 's talk about admitting me back to hospital , but i 'd give anything to avoid that . ' to some , i have the dream body - but to me , my size six figure is nothing but a nightmare . i can only pray that the doctors find the answer soon .
