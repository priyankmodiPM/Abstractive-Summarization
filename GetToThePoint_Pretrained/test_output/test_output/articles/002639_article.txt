' the thought that a person should be made to feel excluded from having access to lovely clothes is absurd and trying to link clothes size to health is also uninformed . ' our ethos at beauty in curves is to make women look and feel great about their bodies and give women more choice and access to great quality premium denim . ' this lady named charlotte happily posed her pictured to twitter in support of plus size women . this lady named kelly said that she was proud of her curves . on thursday , jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments ' really difficult .

' another lady called @ charlottebhc said : ' jamilia consciously wished discomfit on a group of marginalised people , i 'm one of those people # wearethethey [ sic ] . ' debz , who set up wearethethey , told femail she did so because she ' does n't believe in ignoring bullies ' . ' the whole point of the hashtag is not health or weight . people 's health is their own business and if someone chooses to be plus size and healthy or unhealthy that is up to them . the idea behind the hashtag is that even if people are unhealthy , they have a right to buy clothing without being made to feel uncomfortable . ' jamelia called for a large spectrum of people being made to feel uncomfortable just because they could be unhealthy and that will never be acceptable to me or the other people using the # wearetheway tag .

' janet street porter , 68 , then said : ' i was completely in agreement with jamelia and i said you 've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25 , can she run around with her children , can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later ? ' so i do feel like jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on . ' ' of course i do n't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops , ' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on loose women this afternoon ( pictured ) .

' i didn’t make it clear on the show that i was talking about extremes , i was talking about above size 20 and below size six , those sizes being available en masse , ' she said . ' knowing that i offended people really upset me . knowing that i made people question themselves and their choices , it really did upset me . all i can do is apologise for that . ' but the star added : ' i do stand by what i said . i’m a real woman with real opinions . i get paid to voice my opinions . social media users weighed in on twitter , telling jamelia to ' keep it shut ' and accusing the singer of ' stirring up hatred ' on the topic . appearing on good morning america earlier today , jamelia , pictured with gmb presenters kate garraway and susanna reid , said she still stood by her remarks . jamelia said of the reaction : 'it’s been absolutely awful but this is my job . i believe we are all entitled to our opinion .

' speaking on loose women yesterday , in the conversation which sparked the controversy , jamelia said : ' i do not think it 's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle , in the same way i do n't believe that a size zero should be available - it 's not a healthy size for an average woman to be .

' yes , have specialist shops , but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy ... to be available in every high street store , i do n't think that 's right . ' viewers were were enraged by her comments and vented on twitter , with many declaring she should be ' sacked ' from the show , and not a single user taking her side .
