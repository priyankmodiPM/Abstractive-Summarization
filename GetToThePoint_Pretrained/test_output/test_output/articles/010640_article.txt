the florida mailman who caused a major security scare when he landed his gyro-copter on the us capitol lawn on wednesday afternoon was just seconds from being shot out of the sky . house homeland security panel chairman michael mccaul revealed that capitol authorities had doug hughes , 61 , in their sights and were prepared to open fire . ' had it gotten any closer to the speaker 's balcony they have long guns to take it down , but it did n't . it landed right in front , ' mccaul said about the flight which was undetected until authorities actually saw the craft approach . however , hughes claims he informed the secret service and capitol police of his potentially lethal stunt into the no-fly zone , which was designed to draw attention to campaign finance reform and government corruption . speaking prior to the flight and just days after a man shot himself dead in front of the capitol on saturday causing panic , hughes appeared confident he would survive his ' insane ' protest .

' he has no weapons or anything else , ' said michael shanahan to cnn . ' i know him personally . he 's like a pitbull when he has an idea . he wants to wake up the country . ' hughes , who has been planning his ' insane ' d.c. flight for two years was promptly arrested by police and fbi teams moved in quickly afterwards with bomb disposal robots . capitol police did n't immediately identify the pilot or comment on his motive , but a florida postal carrier named doug hughes took responsibility for the stunt on a website where he said he was delivering letters to all 535 members of congress in order to draw attention to campaign finance corruption . ' as i have informed the authorities , i have no violent inclinations or intent , ' hughes wrote on his website , thedemocracyclub.org .

' in a report published by the newspaper prior to this afternoon 's unauthorized landing , hughes said , ' i have got a plane , a gyro-plane . and i 'm going to fly it , i 'm going to violate the no-fly zone , non-violently , ' he says in the video posted to the newspapers website . ' i 'm going to land on the capitol mall . ' speaking to the tampa bay times prior to his flight , hughes said that he had phoned the secret service to tell them he would land in front of the capitol and that he had emailed barack obama 's public email too . he said that he flight would serve as a protest against rampant lobby and interest groups controlling the political process and a wake-up call for security . ' again , i 'm going to fly low and slow and these guys are going to have a full head of adrenaline . eventually , i 'm hoping the blackhawk will catch up with me about the time that the authorities realize that i 'm not a threat and knocking me down is not a politically savvy move , and i anticipate having an escort all the way in . i 'm hoping for a friendly escort . '  recovery : various officials take a close up look at the scene where a small gyro-copter landed on the us capitol lawn . authorities load the gyro-copter onto the back of a truck to remove it from the west front of the us capitol . retrieval : people walk past the gyro-copter that was flown onto the grounds of the u.s. capitol on wednesday . while he got no escort and the authorities were not aware of his incoming flight , hughes is aware of what the consequences will now be . he anticipates losing his job with the us postal service and expects to lose his freedom . he admits to not telling his russian-born wife or his four living children for fear they would be implicated . at the bottom line of his protest is his belief that money has corrupted democracy . ' we 're heading full-throttle toward a breakdown , ' he said to the tampa bay times . ' there 's no question that we need government , but we do n't have to accept that it 's a corrupt government that sells out to the highest bidder . we can have a government that works for the people , that answers to the people , that can only take money from the people in small amounts . ' hughes became politically radicalized two-and-a-half years ago when his 24-year-old son from a previous marriage committed suicide by driving his car head-on into another car - killing the driver . speaking to the tampa bay times , hughes says that ' something changed in me ' and that he realized he had to commit to making a change in this world . he hit upon his daring gyro-copter plan and set up a website and began to email every tv station and newspaper he could . he also told the secret service . indeed , hughes claims an agent came to see him last spring to ask him about his stunt and left him his card . before he set off today , hughes told the times , ' i have thought about walking away from this whole thing because it 's crazy , ' he said . ' but i have also thought about being 80 years old and watching the collapse of this country and thinking that i had an idea once that might have arrested the fall and i did n't do it . ' and i will tell you completely honestly : i 'd rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall . '
