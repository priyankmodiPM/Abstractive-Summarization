if the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs , then watch out for wolves . kenny jackett’s team moved into sixth place in the championship with a fourth successive victory after david edwards , the substitute , headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game . pre-match results had offered wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone , with brentford and ipswich town dropping points unexpectedly , and kenny jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at nottingham forest on friday for a third successive victory . wolves substitute david edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . edwards is congratulated by his wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against leeds . wolves striker benik afobe slides on his knees after scoring his side 's third goal of the afternoon . wolves ( 4-4-2 ) : ikeme ; iorfa , batth , stearman , golbourne ; henry ( van la parra 78mins ) , mcdonald , price , sako ; afobe , dicko ( edwards 70 ) . subs not used : kuszczak , doherty , doyle , ebanks-landell , hause . booked : golbourne , batth . goals : dicko 19 , 45 , afobe 48 , edwards 88 . leeds ( 4-1-4-1 ) : silvestri ;
