juventus goalkeeper gianluigi buffon has no immediate plans to retire and said it would be a waste to quit now when he feels he is still in top form . ' a player stops when he feels that he is no longer what he was before on the pitch , ' buffon , 37 , told reporters after juventus beat monaco 1-0 in the champions league on tuesday . ' looking at it objectively , that is not my case . i will continue to keep playing as long as i am doing well , otherwise it would be a waste . why bid farewell to football if you are playing well ? ' juventus goalkeeper gianluigi buffon says he is not thinking about retiring because he is still playing well . the italy international produced a solid display to stop monaco from scoring an away goal on tuesday night . the juventus captain celebrates after his side recorded a 1-0 win in the first leg of the quarter-final . ' at the first sign of slipping , i would be the first to bow out . i think one should stop playing when goes onto the field and you see that you are no longer the same person , ' he added . buffon , who has helped juventus win three successive serie a titles and is still italy 's first-choice goalkeeper , made three important saves to deny monaco an away goal in tuesday 's game . buffon joined juventus from parma in 2001 , and stayed with them even after they were demoted to serie b following the calciopoli match-fixing scandal in 2006 , the same year he helped italy win the world cup .
