eight san francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended , and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked . chief greg suhr announced in a statement friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . he called the texts ' despicable ' and says those who sent them ' clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer . ' authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks , mexicans , filipinos and gay men , which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs , were sent between 2011 and 2012 . san francisco police chief greg suhr ( pictured ) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . texts between san francisco police department officers included racist , sexist and homophobic messages . suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that do n't have contact with the public . the messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant ian furminger , who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison . ' all n*****s must f*****g hang ' and 'n*****s must be spayed ' were among the texts uncovered . ' it 's not against the law to put an animal down , ' an officer said , referring to a black man in furminger 's house . other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f** . the eight officers include captain jason fox , 42 , a two decade veteran and sergeant michael wibunsin , a 12-year veteran , according to the san francisco chronicle 's sources . officers identified as michael robison , 46 , a 23-year-veteran , noel schwab , 49 , a 16-year-veteran and michael celis , who has been on the force for 16 years , have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign . sean doherty , an 11-year veteran and rain daugherty , a 15-year-officer , are also facing termination . robison , schwab and celis have reportedly already resigned . michael robison , 46 , a 23-year veteran of the force , has resigned . he gave an interview to the advocate in 1999 ( pictured ) about being a gay officer . he said ' the `` good ol ' boys '' system is on its way out ' . the offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former sfpd sergeant ian furminger , who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . the eighth officer has not yet been identified , and was not aware about possible dismissal as of friday . robison is openly gay and told the lgbt magazine the advocate in 1998 : ' the `` good ol ' boys '' system is on its way out , and the newer generation that 's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint ' . he was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed . in 2007 an officer named jason fox was accused of hitting a gay man 's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club . ' do you think we want your aids-infected pee on our streets ? â€™ fox allegedly said . he did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed . police commissioners at the time reached a $ 83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man . the sfpd did not respond to a request for comment from daily mail online about whether the incident involved the same jason fox accused in the text message scandal . san francisco public defender jeff adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . minutes from a san francisco family violence council meeting show that fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013 . celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife 's hotel room . wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $ 10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011 . public defender jeff adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed . he has called for the department of justice to investigate san francisco 's police as it did with officers in ferguson , missouri , according to kqed .
