' i should n't have sat on death row for 30 years , ' hinton told reporters . ' all they had to do was test the gun , ' he said . hinton had strong words about the prosecutors and jury as he spoke to the crowd .

' his attorney brian stevenson said : ' mr . hinton has spent 30 years locked in an 5-by-8 cell and with the state of alabama trying to kill him every day . ' the newly freed man added that is a miscarriage of justice for the victims and their families . the family of one of the men who hinton was convicted of killing was less happy . he told the birmingham news that he was not declared innocent - only that there was not enough evidence to uphold his conviction . ' this is a difficult time for my family and at this time the only thing i have to say is god will have the ultimate decision on if he is guilty or not , ' said jason davidson , the son of john davidson . friends say hinton 's first request after his release - finding a buffet to fill up on all the food he missed in prison . hinton was convicted of the 1985 murders of two birmingham fast-food restaurant managers . crime scene bullets were the only evidence that linked hinton to the crime . however , prosecutors said this week that modern forensic methods did not show the fatal bullets came from a revolver in hinton 's home , or even from the same gun . hinton grabs the arm of his sister darlene gardner ( in the white hat ) as he is greeted by family , supporters and throngs of media on friday . gardner sobbed as she hugged her brother friday . ' thank you lord , than you jesus , ' she could be heard saying . in this undated photo from the alabama doc shows hinton after several years in prison . hinton said he would continue to pray for the victims ' families , as this was a miscarriage of justice for them as well . ' they had every intention of executing me for something i did n't do , ' hinton said . the u.s. supreme court ruled last year that hinton had inadequate counsel and sent the case back for a second trial . prosecutors had been preparing for a retrial but moved to dismiss the case following the testing on the bullets . the supreme court ruled last year that hinton had ' constitutionally deficient ' representation at his initial trial . hinton 's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $ 1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution testimony about the bullets . the lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price , even though he had concerns about the expert 's credentials . at the time , jurors chuckled as the defense expert struggled to answer questions on cross-examination . bryan stevenson , hinton 's attorney and director of the alabama-based equal justice initiative , said he pressed the state for years to re-test the gun , and for years officials refused . he said the case was emblematic of problems with the justice system . stevenson has said hinton was convicted based on bad science because he did n't have the money to prove his innocence at trial . ' he was convicted because he was poor , ' stevenson , who first took on the case 16 years ago , said friday . hinton was greeted by his emotional family members immediately as he walked out of jail as a free man . this week , prosecutors announced they did not have enough evidence to re-try him for two 1985 murders . hinton is seen here with his attorney , who is carrying a paper bag with the 58-year-old 's posessions from his decades in prison . hinton hugs a friend , martha griggers , as he celebrates his freedom after three decades on death row . hinton 's friend ms griggers appeared overjoyed to see him as he left prison on friday . hinton became overwhelmed with emotion several times as friends and family members met him outside the jail on friday . hinton declared , ' the sun does shine ' as he spoke to reporters following his release . hinton 's lawyer says he was convicted because he was a poor man in alabama and did not have the resources to defend himself .
