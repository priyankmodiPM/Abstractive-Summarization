' it 's difficult to explain and give justification for it , but my understanding it i was isolated , not comfortable with myself and my sexuality , had low self-esteem with my job , depression with work , moving from job to job and that 's put me under pressure and pushed me for this impulsive behaviour . al-atraqchi said he secretly filmed the men to ' let off steam ' because his job was very stressful . ' i wish i could apologise . to be honest , on reflection , one thing that would stop me doing it is i would n't accept this would be done to me . if i can , i apologise . ' officers seized two mobile telephones one showing secret footage of a man unwittingly exposing his private parts in 2011 . hamish common for the general medical council told the doctor he had ' impulsive behaviour . ' he said : ' you had a shampoo bottle and the fact there were two shampoo bottles found in your possession in march 2014 by the assistant manager means you must have used the shampoo or otherwise got rid of it out of the bottle , emptied it , and dried it out . you opened up the shampoo , cleaned it and put in the iphone . ' there was a hole cut in the lynx bottle in such a place to expose the lens of the camera to the outside world . would it be reasonable to assume there has been some planning and preparation in the construction of this albeit rudimentary apparatus ? ' al-atraqchi 's lawyer claimed the doctor had suffered ' shame and humiliation ' as a result of being caught and he posed a low risk to patient safety . he had also been allowed to carry on working despite the incidents . but the tribunal panel said : ' the convictions demonstrate a lack of integrity in that you recorded people secretly , in a state of undress and without their consent . the panel is also concerned about your level of insight . it has been described as ' poor ' in one report and it is only lately that you are able to say that you are ' getting there ' in terms of your offending behaviour . ' the panel does not consider that your insight is fully developed and considers that you remain at risk of repeating the behaviour . ' your offences undermine public confidence in the profession and the panel considers that a reasonable member of the public , in possession of all the facts , would be deeply troubled by the behaviour in which you engaged . ' al-atraqchi will learn his fate next week .
