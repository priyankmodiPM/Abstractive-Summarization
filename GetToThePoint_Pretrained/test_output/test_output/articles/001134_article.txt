carlisle united manager keith curle has launched a scathing attack on his side following their limp 3-1 defeat away at accrington stanley , even suggesting that some players ' do n't deserve to be professionals . ' the cumbrians are without a win in five games in league two and are just two places and three points in the table above the relegation zone . ' the strength of character in that changing room is alarmingly week , ' curle said to bbc radio cumbria after the match at the crown ground . carlisle united boss keith curle has laid into his players following their dismal 3-1 loss at accrington stanley . he added , ' you 've got to be accountable for yourself and have pride , there are players who ca n't say they care they put in a performance . they are players who do n't deserve to be professionals ' . carlisle were relegated from league one last season and have just five games left this term to avoid a similar fate . but curle was demonstrably cynical as to their chances . ' there 's no spirit in this changing room , ' he said . the 51-year-old also revealed he was considering staging an open forum for the club 's supporters . ' i might get 50 supporters to come down , have an open forum and through ( club chairman ) andrew jenkins they can have half an hour with the players . ' they can tell them exactly what they think of them , and they 'll have to take it . supporters can see when people are n't giving everything for the shirt . '
