' and it is this slow and steady approach that seems to be making him the critics ' favourite . in 2013 when he starred in the broadway play orphans he was nominated for a prestigious tony award . the reviewer for the hollywood reporter , david rooney , singled out tom 's ' killer broadway debut ' performance , writing : ' he shows astonishing athleticism and expressive physicality , leaping from one surface to another with simian agility or shrinking into a huddled ball . ' but he also conveys the alert mind ticking away behind the stuttering words and the twitchy , obsessive behaviour . ' there 's a distinct sense here of a docile but unpredictable caged animal , literally about to burst with pent-up energy . ' tom counts andrew garfield ( left ) and robert pattinson ( right ) among his close friends . in 2012 tom starred alongside rob 's then on / off girlfriend kristen stewart and is thought to have been close friends with the actress . but his sheer talent and growing reputation may come as a surprise to those who knew tom growing up , as unlike many of his peers , he never planned to be an actor . born into a thespian family - his father charles sturridge directed the original brideshead revisited series as well as a handful of dust , and his mother is actress phoebe nicholls - tom told the telegraph : ' as children , my siblings and i were actively discouraged from acting . i have no memories of going on set with my parents – aside from gulliver 's travels . ' his father cast him in the tv special starring ted danson because he wanted a child actor he could talk to . the actor remembered : ' all i remember is occasionally having conversations with my father and then someone filming me . ' but he began to rebel against the acting world he knew so well and struggled with life at the elite £13,500-a-year harrodian school in west london ( where he met best friend robert pattinson ) . he said : ' i left school early in my last year before i took my a-levels . i was n't expelled . it was just a mutual understanding . i was n't interested in going to school and they said , `` you 're not turning up '' , so we severed ties . both sides appreciated it . ' that rebellious streak certainly shows up in his distinctive scruffy , trendy style - his penchant for skinny jeans , pork pie hats , lumberjack shirts and skinny ties - and earned him the notice of fashion house burberry who cast tom and his fiancee sienna in a moody black and white ad together . sienna and tom got together in 2011 , not long after she split from jude for the second time . the pair became engaged soon after and they welcomed their daughter marlowe on july 7 , 2012 . sienna says that being with tom and having their daughter marlowe - born in 2012 - has changed her life . although discreet about their life together , the short clip filmed by mario testino provided a touching insight into the couple 's strong bond as they flirted , laughed , gazed into each others ' eyes and kissed passionately . creative director christopher bailey said : ' this was a shoot full of love and laughter . it was such a treat to work with sienna and tom , and to capture their magic together . ' that ' magic ' is something sienna is profoundly grateful for . in december , the 33-year-old told vogue : ' tom is a grounded , intelligent , kind , and intact person . that 's amazing to be around . that 's the father of my child . there 's no drama . ' of having their daughter marlowe in july 2012 she said : ' i was overwhelmed by how normal it felt . it was like , `` there you are - that 's what i have been missing '' . ' like we 're both in on something only we know . an amazing sense of being complicit with a little being . ' tom attended the 2015 oscars vanity fair party with his fiance sienna and his best friend robert pattinson . today the pair are one of the most sought-after on the party circuit but keeping their life low-key is a priority . sienna said : ' we go to the country . i like to cook and go to whole foods . i have a [ newfoundland ] dog - not a dog but a bear - who when i walk pulls me over flat on my face into the mud . ' my baby pukes on me . it 's life . it 's very much a normal life . i really do n't want to sound boring . it 's completely crazy and illicit behind closed doors . ' in a 2009 interview tom revealed that he carried a private journal everywhere with him in which he wrote stories and musings . he said : ' i write constantly , about everything . ' now as tom prepares for big screen stardom , the question now is not whether he has enough to jot into his diary , but whether he has the time .
