' now i am looking at him in a sexual way instead of just looking at him like he 's my bud , ' the 30-year-old said of her new husband . scroll down for video . look of love : jaclyn methuen and ryan ranellone enjoyed a bottle of wine during their first night at their new apartment in astoria , queens , on last night 's episode of married at first sight . next step : the newlyweds later headed to their bedroom leaving viewers to wonder whether they finally ' consummated their marriage ' . and while viewers have to wait until next week 's episode to see if the newlyweds did indeed take their relationship to the next level , jaclyn hinted that physical intimacy is definitely going to develop - and soon . ' we have n't consummated our marriage yet , but it seems like [ in ] the imminent future that is going to happen , ' she told the cameras coyly . jaclyn previously noted that she had n't had sex in two years and she hoped it was like ' riding a bike ' . the episode began with ryan , 29 , who lives in stony brook , long island , with his mother and his teenage niece kayla , traveling over three hours to spend his first night at jaclyn 's home in union , new jersey . and despite jaclyn’s initial reluctance to show any kind of enthusiasm for the marriage , it was clear that the pair had slowly started working towards a mutual feeling of respect – and romance . ryan couldn’t have been more thrilled about seeing his wife’s abode , admitting that the closer he got to her home , the more excited he became to see his new wife . meanwhile , jaclyn was delighted to show ryan her home , noting that she sees the potential for their relationship more than ever . ca n't do it : ryan visited jaclyn 's apartment in union , new jersey but told her it was too far away from his real estate job in long island . major compromise : during dinner , the couple agreed to move to astoria because it was the halfway point from their two homes . ' i am actually really excited he is coming over . i miss ryan when he is gone , and it is surprising that i miss him - surprising for me because i do n't really miss anybody , ' she admitted . while the couple enjoyed a nice evening together , it quickly became apparent that the commute from the new jersey location was too far for ryan , who works as a real estate agent in long island . ' i would love to make a life together here , but no way , ca n't do it , ' he told her , as jaclyn worried that finding a place to live would become a road block in their relationship . later the two met over dinner and agreed to move to astoria , queens , because that is the halfway point between their homes . jaclyn only requested that she could bring her cat and that there would be parking . ' this is my new life . i am married now , ' she said . ' this is the first major compromise that we are making . ' final decision : ryan and jaclyn can be seen shaking their realtor 's hand after they agree on their first apartment together . hug it out : the newlyweds , who were excited about taking the next step together , embraced in their new kitchen . and when it came to budgeting their finances , jaclyn admitted that she has to have money immediately taken out of her check and moved to savings because she is a ' spender ' by nature . ryan , who proclaimed that he was a saver , made it clear that he wanted to make his new wife happy and he did n't want her to give anything up she enjoyed . ' do n't sacrifice what makes you happy for the sake of where we are going to live , ' he said of the cost of her dance classes , which she was worried would be too expensive to afford after their move . ' we will make it work . ' the two also agreed to split the cost of living in half , so they would both be contributing the same amount . after looking at a few places in astoria , they agreed on a spacious one bedroom apartment for $ 2,000 a month . emotional moment : ryan was sad to leave his mother and his teenage niece kayla . new life together : jaclyn packed up her wardrobe as she prepared to move in with ryan . ' jaclyn and i are getting close , and i am starting to feel great about this whole experiment , ' ryan told the cameras , while jaclyn noted that the pair ' can be really happy ' in their new apartment . on moving day , jaclyn received a visit from her sister and her best friend who offered her moral support . and while she was packing up her belongings , she revealed to her closest confidants that she is seeing her husband in a whole new light . ' flying home on the plane , i feel like somebody flipped a switch , ' she said of her recent trip to spend the holidays with her husband . ' i was looking at him like this is my best friend ever and we 're buddies , and now i am looking at him differently . ' she went on to tell the cameras that she is now ' looking at him in a sexual way ' . newlyweds : when they arrived at their new place , ryan carried jaclyn over the threshold . what to do : the two took a moment to figure out where they should place all of their things . ' i am looking at him like a man , ' she added . meanwhile , ryan got emotional as he said goodbye to his mother and his niece . although he maintained that he wanted to be married and move in with jaclyn , he admitted that it was hard to leave his family . on the first night in their new apartment , the two unpacked a bit before enjoying a bottle of wine and some pizza . ' i want to be more touchy and feely with you , ' jaclyn told ryan as they cuddled on the couch . huge adjustment : davina kullar , 34 , and sean varricchio , 35 , can be seen speaking with real estate agent in manhattan as they searched for a place on the upper east side . not happy : sean , who is from new jersey , was overwhelmed by how small the apartments in manhattan were . ' what should we do to christen the apartment ? ' ryan teased . and when jaclyn asked if he meant consummate the marriage , he joked : ' i am a nice catholic boy . ' but the two eventually made their way to bedroom , leaving viewers wondering if they were finally going to become intimate weeks after their wedding day . as for davina kullar , 34 , and sean varricchio , 35 , the move seemed to be tearing them apart . davina refused to move out of manhattan , and as she waited for her apartment to be renovated , she and sean looked for a new place that they could stay temporarily . but it quickly became apparent that sean , who is an er/trauma nurse from jackson , new jersey , was uncomfortable with city life as he started to pull away from his new wife . life decision : the couple finally agreed on a place to stay while davina 's apartment gets renovated . hear-to-heart : davina told sean that he needs to show her more affection after he started pulling away from her . after the two finally agree on a place to stay on the upper east side , sean continued to be overwhelmed . ' i can feel myself pulling back . we 're not affectionate . we 're not intimate , ' he admitted . davina confessed to the cameras that sean 's actions made her worry that his distance was about more than just geographical location and adjusting to living in new york city . she finally told him that she needs him to be more affectionate . ' why am i helping you adapt to manhattan , if you do n't really want to be here , ' she asked during their heart-to-heart . stressed out : jessica castro , 30 , and ryan deniro , 29 , learned the bedroom in this apartment is in a completely different unit than the living room and bathroom . not our home : jessica and ryan can be seen having a heated discussion about an apartment they both liked . while she thought it was too expensive , ryan said that he just wanted to take care of her and make her happy . although sean agreed to make more of an effort , he later told her that he had to return to new jersey for work , leaving her alone in their apartment on what was supposed to be their first night together . meanwhile , jessica castro , 30 , and ryan deniro , 29 , struggled to figure out where they both should live – and how they should budget for it . while ryan owns a consulting business in staten island , jessica , who works as a receptionist in manhattan , does n't know how to drive , so the two compromised by agreeing to move to brooklyn . after visiting numerous apartments , ryan believed he found the one , but jessica was n't thrilled with the $ 4,000 per month price tag . jessica could only afford to contribute $ 1,000 towards their rent , and she did n't like the idea of ryan covering so much more of the bill . team work : after agreeing on a place in brooklyn , ryan helped jessica pack on their moving day . all better : the two kissed in the bedroom of their new apartment in brooklyn . ' we need to be able to discuss what we are spending our money on as a married couple , ' she explained . ' i would rather invest for down the line , if we stay together , to buy something . ' but ryan said that he just wants to see ' jess happy , ' explaining : ' as a man i want to take care of her ' . the newlyweds let the apartment go , and they eventually find one that is not only perfect , but it 's in their price range . ' this is our first big decision together , ' jessica said of their new place . ' i hope we are on the right page . '
