' united have had to persuade planning bosses that the development would not disturb the local bat population . as part of their proposals , called in a bat expert to inspect the premises where the likes of wayne rooney , juan mata and ander herrera hone their skills . particular concerns were raised over the impact of the three species spotted at the rural location , the common pipistrelle , soprano pipistelle and daunbenton 's . however , trafford council have now granted planning application and work should start shortly . van gaal would prefer them to prepare by training under lights ahead of a night match to replicate conditions . the installation of the lights will also allow van gaal extra time to work with his charges in bleak winters . the installation of the lights will also allow van gaal , who famously spends hours on the training ground , extra time to work with his charges in the notoriously bleak manchester winters . united 's planning application stated : ' the benefit of the floodlighting is that it will allow for greater use of the training pitches , particularly during the winter months . ' this is essential in enabling the football club to compete with other clubs , both at domestic and international levels . the floodlighting will enhance the usability and function of the training centre , further helping to maintain its world class status . ' the likes of self-confessed coronation street fan rooney and co , however , will not find themselves there late at night . approval was granted on the condition that the lights were not used between the hours of 9pm and 9am . manchester united manager van gaal speaks during a press conference at the training centre last week .
