' prosecutor : mr hamilton-miller served in india for much of world war ii and arrived in bergen-belsen shortly after its liberation in may 1945 . bergen-belsen was a nazi concentration camp in lower saxony , germany . it was initially intended to hold prisoners of war , but in 1943 , parts of the camp became a ' transit camp ' for , mainly jewish , civilian prisoners , the camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 jews , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and disabled , and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by british and canadian troops in april 1945 . after qualifying as a solicitor in 1935 , cambridge educated mr hamilton-miller was enlisted into the territorial army in 1936 and then , in 1939 , was granted an emergency commission as 2nd lieutenant in the border regiment . for much of the war he served in india , until in 1944 he returned to britain on leave and was posted to carlisle . this ended abruptly on april 15 , 1945 when the 11th armoured division of the british army liberated bergen-belsen . recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers , mr hamilton-miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the british liberation army , 49 reinforcement holding unit , where he was appointed staff captain to 21 army group hq , war crimes investigation team , arriving at belsen sometime after may 5 to a horrific , challenging and distressing scene . mr hamilton-miller 's role appears to have been to assist major savile geoffrey champion , head of no . 1 war crimes investigation unit , belsen , to prepare the legal cases against the ss camp personnel . mr miller added : ' cecil 's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard . ' gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial . ' the first belsen trial began on september 17 , 1945 , at luneburg town hall and took the form of a military tribunal . up in smoke : bergen-belsen , which became the final resting place of 20,000 pows and 50,000 jews , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . the trial of the prison guard , called rothe , who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison . mr hamilton-miller was also responsible for the camp commandant kramer , the doctor , dr klein , and nine guards , being sentenced to death by hanging . nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year , with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years . mr miller added : ' many inmates at belsen had been moved hurriedly from auschwitz , and cecil 's unit took evidence from witnesses against nazi criminals such as dr mengele , guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers , as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them .
