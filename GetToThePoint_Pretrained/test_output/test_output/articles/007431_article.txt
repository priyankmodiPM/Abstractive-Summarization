it 's not something parking wardens are usually accused of ... but some have been criticised for being too nice . an inspection in two welsh towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets , letting many locals get away with parking offences . and their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a ‘ free for all’ . inspectors in welshpool and llandrindod wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements ( file picture ) . the investigation was carried out by officials from powys county council , who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions . powys council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even . councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of welshpool and llandrindod wells and found there were plenty of infringements , but many were going unticketed . in one case , a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes , but the warden ‘ still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket’ . officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas – even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits . the councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘ would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’ . even when tickets were issued , 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge . the councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘ would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’ ( file picture ) . the investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation , including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued . they said wardens are currently leaving it ‘ too long’ , particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time . they also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across powys as ‘ decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations’ . some 5,000 tickets are issued in powys , bringing in £1.2million a year , but the council is still subsidising the operation . the report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service ‘ cost neutral’ .
