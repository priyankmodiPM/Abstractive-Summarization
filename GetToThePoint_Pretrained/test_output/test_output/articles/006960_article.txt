yorkshire have signed india international cheteshwar pujara until the end of may after cancelling the contract of younis khan . younus was set to be yorkshire 's overseas signing for 2015 , but the batsman is now looking to be part of pakistan 's potential touring party to bangladesh , effectively ruling him out of any playing time in the lv= county championship . pujara will instead link up with the division one champions - subject to receiving a work permit - having spent time at the back end of last season with derbyshire , scoring 219 championship runs for them . yorkshire director of cricket martyn moxon announced in a statement that younus made his international intentions clear on sunday , and added : ' we have moved quickly to bring in pujara and he is a superb player . indian batsman cheteshwar pujara has joined yorkshire on a deal until the end of may . ' he is an outstanding young test cricketer , who is hungry to perform in the english game . in the brief conversations i have had with him , he is very much looking forward to be joining yorkshire and being part of our plans . ' pujara , 27 , made his international test debut in 2010 , and with six centuries in the five-day game is a highly rated part of india 's squad with many seeing him as the natural successor to rahul dravid . pujara , who boasts nearly 9,000 first-class runs , will turn out for yorkshire until australian aaron finch is free of indian premier league commitments with mumbai indians . ' i was looking to return to the uk after my previous experience of county cricket , which i greatly enjoyed , and when yorkshire made the offer i did n't think twice , ' pujara said . ' to wear the same white rose sachin tendulkar did is going to be a great feeling for me . i hope i can contribute to further success . '
