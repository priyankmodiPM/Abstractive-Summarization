' i went to the front , took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy , ' heslip told the huffington post . he accepted ray 's offer to join the show as the ' bubble boy ' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare . for heslip , the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged . he noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face , but now he does . ' i do n't feel a lot of pain from the bumps , ' heslip told the huffington post . ' i have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive , but not so much now . ' to have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before . heslip said : ' when i met the performers , there was a feeling of belonging . i felt at home ' . staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support . ray said that some people will see heslip 's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious . as heslip manages his job in tuscon and his new role as a performer , he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the venice beach freakshow . the job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about nf-1 . ' i want to teach people that it 's not taboo to ask questions . i 'm ok talking about it , ' he told the huffington post . ' my son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited . they know my attitude is positive .
