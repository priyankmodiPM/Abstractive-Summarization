( cnn ) they may not be `` star trek '' -type extraterrestrials , but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life , a nasa scientist says . `` i think we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade , and i think we 're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years , '' nasa chief scientist ellen stofan said tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe . `` we know where to look . we know how to look , '' she said . `` in most cases , we have the technology , and we 're on a path to implementing it . and so i think we 're definitely on the road . '' nasa released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies , including the dwarf planet ceres and jupiter 's moon europa . the hubble space telescope has been key to the discoveries , nasa said in a news release . `` scientists using nasa 's hubble space telescope recently provided powerful evidence that ( jupiter 's moon ) ganymede has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice , '' the agency noted . there are some caveats involved , of course . nasa is n't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the alpha quadrant ; it 's referring to microorganisms . `` we are not talking about little green men , '' stofan said at the panel . `` we are talking about little microbes . '' still , former astronaut john grunsfeld said it 's an exciting time -- and he thinks it 's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well . `` i think we 're one generation away in our solar system , whether it 's on an icy moon or on mars , and one generation on a planet around a nearby star , '' he said . and , he added , who knows what that life will look like ? `` once we get out beyond mars , the likelihood that it 's similar to earth because we share that material gets very , very low , '' he said . `` and i think that 's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting .
