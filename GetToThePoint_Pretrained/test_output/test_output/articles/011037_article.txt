' i was pumped full of antibiotics and developed painful thrush all over my body , ' she said . ' it was in my fingers , feet and mouth . ' it did n't clear for ages . ' it was while she was in hospital that doctors offered her weight-loss surgery . julia now weighs a healthy 11 stone and is a size 12 . ' i used food as an emotional crutch , ' she admits . ' my husband is from belgium and when i married him in 1993 i went from a slim 11.5 stone to 18 stone within two years . ' i was homesick and i just kept eating . i suffered with post-natal depression and every time i had a child my binge eating worsened . ' julia says that a communication breakdown with her stefan led her to devour her favourite snacks and by 2011 , she 'd reached rock bottom . ' there was no communication between me and my husband and i was really isolated . food was my friend and i needed a friend . so i binged .

' i was heavily addicted to sugar . biscuits , cakes , ice-cream ... i loved it all . the only savoury thing i ate was pizza . if i was on a binge cycle i would eat crisps and cereal . ' the situation got so bad that julia would hide food from her family so they were unaware of how bad her eating had got . ' i hid food in the medicine cabinet so my family did n't know what i was doing.they did n't know i was buying extra . looking back my husband must have been aware . the carer described her eating as ' a form of self-harm ' . ' ice cream was my biggest splurge , ' she said . ' i would eat a family-sized pizza and two tubs of ice cream in an hour . i could n't stop . ' doctors agreed that julia could be a candidate for weight loss surgery but first they said that she had to shed some pounds . so , in january 2013 she started only drinking juice . she was inspired by the story of joe cross , an australian who weighed more than 22 stone but lost more than seven stone by sticking to a juice diet . he wrote a book , fat , sick and nearly dead , which mrs van herck heard about . ' this led to me losing weight and wanting to eat fruit and vegetables , ' she said . ' i even started exercising . ' just look at us now : julia and husband stefan decided they wanted to stay together and julia realised that all the fears that she 'd had were just down to a lack of confidence . life overhaul : julia now eats healthier foods and even goes to the gym and has a new wardrobe . by october 2013 she was four stone lighter and doctors agreed she could undergo weight loss surgery at st mary 's hospital in london , which proved successful . now she weighs 11 stone and loves healthy food . she never binges . ' i realised i had been causing myself pain by eating , ' she said . ' now i am much happier . i buy smaller clothes and feel confident in myself . ' and to prove just how far she has come , julia has stepped back into her bridal gown after rekindling her relationship with stefan . ' i spoke to my husband and he did n't want to split up . it was in my head because i was n't confident . ' i 've stopped taking anti-depressants for the first time in my life . ' the sky 's the limit now , it seems : ' i 've even started going to the gym and can now run much further than i used to be able to walk without losing breath . i 'm a new woman . ' the nhs said : ' binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis through regular binges . ' people who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time , even when they are not hungry . ' binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying ' special ' binge foods . ' joe cross ' new film fat , sick & nearly dead 2 will air on channel 5 , 7pm on april 21 .
