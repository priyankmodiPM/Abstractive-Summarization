negotiations to make a fight between paul smith and andre ward are set to be concluded this week , with the liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing 's biggest talents on june 20 . sportsmail understands discussions are virtually finalised for the summer showdown , with a formal announcement of the fight expected imminently . elements of the deal are still being rubber-stamped and wardâ€™s wba world title is unlikely to be on the line . however , the fight , which will be staged in oakland , california , will run over the 12-round distance . liverpool boxer paul smith ( left ) is in line to take on andre ward on june 20 . ward ( right ) has won all of his 24 bouts but has not fought since defeating edwin rodriguez in november . it is a huge opportunity for smith but an even bigger task against a fighter who outclassed carl froch in 2011 . smith , 32 , has lost back-to-back world title challenges in germany against arthur abraham , albeit in controversial circumstances in the first of those fights when a wide decision was handed to abraham from a close bout . smith has lost his last two world title challenges to arthur abraham ( left ) of germany . ward defeated carl froch in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats smith . smith 's hope this time round will be that ward , usually so slick and brilliantly accurate , has diminished through inactivity . the 31-year-old , an olympic champion and winner of all 27 of his professional fights , has not fought since november 2013 . that period of absence will add a fascinating dimension to a fight that will catch the attention of froch , who would postpone retirement for a home rematch against ward .
