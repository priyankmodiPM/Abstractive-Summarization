' earlier this year , residents in the stratford district were named as among the best recyclers in england , the stratford observer reported . council chiefs in stratford-upon-avon were left red-faced after a leaflet promoting recycling ... could not itself be recycled ( file photo ) . according to official government figures , stratford district council was in the top ten councils for recycling and composting for the second year running . the recycling rate of just over 59 per cent for 2013/14 put stratford eighth out of 352 authorities nationwide . district spokesman councillor mike brain said : ' this is great news and it 's thanks to our residents that we 've been able to achieve this result with their commitment and support for recycling . ' the service we provide is designed to make recycling easy and our residents have responded to that by ensuring they recycle as much rubbish as possible and by limiting the amount of other waste that is produced . ' it is important that residents continue to recycle and one of the reasons why we are performing so high is because more residents are regularly putting food in the green bin and the weekly collection of electric / electronic goods , textiles and batteries is still proving very popular . ' the leaflet – attached to green bins – told stratford-upon-avon residents what items could go in them but a footnote said : ' this is not recyclable ' ( file photo ) .
