if you open your suitcase after leaving the airport with damaged goods inside , this might be the reason why . an airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it 's a somewhat cut and thrust job . as the suitcases whizz round on the belt , out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track . the red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane . suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force . and with a sharp movement , the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt . the mechanism appears to work on a sensor system , ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it , but what might shock is the force of the action . it is not known where this video was taken , although it is believed to be an international airport . however baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world , with dutch company vanderlande market leaders in the machinery . their ' parallel pusher , ' similar to the one in this video , is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only . when the pusher is activated , a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor . this suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds . the arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner . the video , after being uploaded to youtube , has been met with mixed responses . user stephanie o wrote : ' this is the real reason why your baggage is destroyed at the airport ' , while sarah cartwright added : ' vicious airport baggage packer . ' dmtryp says what most people would think on viewing the video , writing : ' hope none of the souvenirs were made out of glass or ceramics . '
