sebastien pocognoli has risked the wrath of his manager tony pulis , after publicly stating his confusion at losing his place in the west brom team . the belgian defender was an important player under alan irvine but since he left the club , the left back has found his game time limited . speaking to la meuse , he admitted he could n't get his head around the decisions being made . ' i do not understand . i have also got no explanation as to why i do n't play . sebastien pocognoli ( centre ) says he 's baffled by tony pulis ' decision to drop him from the starting 11 . ' even if my ( left-back rival ) is injured or suspended i do n't get a chance . that 's frustrating because i feel very happy in birmingham and i have a good relationship with the fans . ' pocognoli insists that he does n't want to be one of the those players to throw a strop but may be forced to consider his long-term future . he said : ' i will not cause trouble , because i am not that type , the end of the season is approaching and i am waiting for the club to tell me their plans . ' after i played 15 good games , i know that some clubs have followed me . it is too early to talk about that , but i want to stay in the premier league . ' i have a good life here and at age 27 i think of everything . but i am also open to a new league . ' it 's been a turbulent season for west brom but has improved since pulis took over from alan irvine .
