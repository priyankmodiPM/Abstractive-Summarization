' gibson , 23 , created a social media empire and the whole pantry movement on the story of her remarkable cancer survival . her wellness app and clean-eating cookbook promised to help her 300,000 plus followers live ' the whole life .

' she got up and gave that amazing speech . you guys were there . she had all of us in tears . she was very believable and i think we all wanted to believe her , ' she said . ' i mean who’s going to question when someone is talking about that they’ve got cancer and they’re going through this horrendous life experience ? ' ' i created the the world 's best health , fitness and lifestyle app - and through that we are changing lives , ' gibson said in her acceptance speech at the cosmo awards last year . in her speech , ms gibson said she was ' incredibly honoured ' that people wanted to share her life .

' i also am very cautious of where everybody goes from here . obviously what belle did is terrible and it’s irresponsible and it’s all of those things but she’s also now getting this lashing of bullying and the last 48 hours would have been horrendous for her . she needs now to get help and move through this , ' she said on air . ' what she doesn’t need now is the whole of australia ganging up on her and bullying her ... even though everyone has the right to feel misled and duped . '
