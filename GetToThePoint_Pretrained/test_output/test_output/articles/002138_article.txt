this is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet-footed bird . the ferocious feline was chasing what was sure to be dinner when it slipped on the icy surface and lost its footing . as the tiger raced towards the bird , it flew directly upwards forcing the mammal to try and stop dead in its tracks . oops-a-daisy ! this tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in china . on the attack : at first all was well , with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal . target : as the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up , ready to grab its prey from the air . fail : the tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer libby zhang . hang time : the slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back , with the bird now well out of reach . but momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground . the hilarious moment took place at the hengdaohezi siberian tiger park in northeast china and was captured by photographer libby zhang . libby , from houston in texas , was visiting the park and photographing the tigers ' feeding session . love your tiger feet : the hilarious moment took place at the hengdaohezi siberian tiger park in northeast china . roaringly funny : the photographer said that a watching crowd burst out laughing when the tiger fell over . she said : ' the crowd burst out in a roar of laughter - it was during feeding time and several chickens were tossed at the tigers . ' one tiger tried to reach it but he lost his balance on the slippery icy and fell backwards . ' i was surprised to see the tiger slip and raised my camera in a hurry with rapid fires on the trigger . ' i wanted to capture the beauty and power of tigers in the same image , but this tiger slip series was a total surprise and added bonus for my trip . '
