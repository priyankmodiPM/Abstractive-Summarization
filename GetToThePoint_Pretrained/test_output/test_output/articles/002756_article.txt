if you are an aspiring manager in english football and you are black , you get used to one thing : when an opportunity comes your way , it’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass . sorry , but it’s true . with a few exceptions , you don’t get the better opportunities . you get the football version of mopping up the toilets . chris ramsey , the only black manager in the premier league , is a classic example . ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs . chris ramsey ( right ) and kevin hitchcock watch qpr hammer west brom to keep their survival hopes alive . ramsey takes nots during his side 's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost . he took the qpr position after harry redknapp , a talented , experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble , saw the writing on the wall and got out . ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and , guess what , it has not been an easy job to refloat it . before the victory at west brom , qpr were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on ramsey . just as predictably , there were also those saying ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance . john barnes ' troubled reign at celtic ended after an infamous scottish cup defeat by inverness caley thistle . if ramsey is sacked , people will say it was about results , not race . and they will be wrong . because race was why he had to take the job in the first place . people tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the english game . some got angry again when john barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he’s black . he was right . the fact ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at qpr does not mean he is not a good manager . it just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass , the odds are you’re going to get hurt .
