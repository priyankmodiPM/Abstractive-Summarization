' the caller even pretended he knew of a list of previous transactions the elderly couple had made , initially rattling off eight incorrect withdrawals before correctly guessing a £50 shopping bill at asda . consequently the couple were persuaded to go to their local leeds building society and make transfers from their account and makes others from their hsbc savings totalling £36,140 to other accounts . the cash was immediately withdrawn after the transfers and were used pay for travellers cheques and euros at travel agents . the elderly couple tried to get their money back when they realised they had been duped but their plea was refused after the banks said staff had acted ' without negligence and acted upon instruction . ' sheree claimed she was approached by a friend from school who asked her if she wanted to make some money . but the actual conman who made the calls and pretended to be a police officer has never been traced . the couple later told police the fraudster who claimed to be ' detective sgt mcdonald from holborn police ' was ' extremely well spoken ' and ' sounded as though he knew what he was talking about .

' she described him as extremely well spoken and seemed to know what he was talking about . he asked about seven or eight transactions and one was eventually confirmed by the lady but it was a lucky guess . ' he told them if asked by members of staff at the bank where the monies were going that they effectively lie and say it was for home improvements , because it was believed the person was within the bank was involved in the gang who were operating the fraud . if queried they were to say it was for a new kitchen or bathroom . ' the couple will not be compensated by the banks . the bank said the bank staff acted without negligence and acted on instruction , they asked what the money was for . they have no intention of refunding that amount of money .

' your offending is vile and were there any suspicion that any of you knew what was going on or even suspected what was going on and the source of the money , you would go immediately to prison . ' quite clearly none of you suspected the true source of money although all suspected it was criminal money in one way or another . ' after the case the pensioners said : ' as far as we are concerned it 's over and done with . it was a bad time and we want to forget it . '
