a spanish town on the camino de santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path . graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of santiago de compostela , in north-western spain , have been erected in the municipality of lastres . but no one knows who put up the signs , which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it . someone in the municipality of lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . the pilgrimage , known as the way of st james , attracts thousands of pilgrims every year , but there can be very few places to go when nature calls . in lastres , angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes . the signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter . the pilgrimage begins at various points , with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the spain-france border , which lead to the cathedral of santiago de compostela , where saint james the great is said to be buried . antonio fernandez , a resident of lastres , told spain’s efe news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction . some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles ( 800 kilometres ) to the cathedral of santiago de compostela . pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them , he added . two other residents , jose ramon fernandez and his wife , maria paz , said they were surprised the warning signs were posted , as the pilgrims ‘ are very polite’ and ‘ always friendly’ . lantres is a parish in santos , and its mayor said ‘ it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route . julio gallego told the spanish newspaper la voz de galicia that it is a ‘ huge failure’ that needs to be remedied .
