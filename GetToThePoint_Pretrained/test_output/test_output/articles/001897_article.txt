' mr miliband said : ' the logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor . we are better than that . we ca n't be leaving people to drown . ' earlier , he said : ' we can not stand by as people drown in european waters simply to escape conflict in libya and syria . if i was prime minister , i would be working with other european leaders to act . ' local residents and rescue workers help a migrant woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of rhodes , southeastern greece , yesterday . around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach europe in boats launched from libya . but senior conservative minister william hague insisted that the rescue missions had not helped . he also defended the government 's intervention in libya in libya 2011 , helping to overthrow colonel gaddafi . he said it would be ' wrong to think that whatever 's happened in libya in the last few years is the cause of this ' . tunisian mohammed ali malek , 27 , was arrested when in sicily last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the mediterranean killing hundreds of migrants . he added on bbc radio 5live : ' let me remind you of something as well , which is that when colonel gaddafi was still in power , there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this , to get into boats and try to go to europe â€“ that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on europe . ' so i do n't think that is the change in this situation ; i think this is a problem that goes well beyond libya . ' the deputy prime minister , nick clegg , said the priority for stopping the migrant crisis had to be to stop people boarding boats rather than stepping up patrols in the mediterranean . he said : ' [ it is ] the human traffickers and smugglers who are peddling this terrible trade which is leading to so many people dying in the mediterranean . ' and i think if we can do [ tackle ] that and provide more aid and assistance in north africa to encourage people to stay put rather than risk life and limb moving great distances , that it seems to me is a more sustainable solution than coming up with lots of arbitrary numbers about who takes in which number of migrants from north africa . and that 's where the focus of our attention should be in the summit tomorrow .
