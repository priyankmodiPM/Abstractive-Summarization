all eyes will be on ap mccoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but i have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him . the 19-time champion jockey could have ridden cause of causes who , like his mount shutthefrontdoor , is owned by his boss jp mcmanus . he has ridden him three times before . while it was ultimately no surprise he chose shutthefrontdoor , a runner with strong credentials , cause of causes also has very good reasons why he should be backed . cause of causes at cheltenham last month . he was second at the 2014 cheltenham festival and then landed the four-mile national hunt chase at last month’s meeting . that marks him down as a quality performer , and he is ridden by a grand national winning jockey in paul carberry ( bobbyjo , 1999 ) and trained by a race-winning trainer in gordon elliott ( silver birch , 2007 ) . his four mile cheltenham win indicates reserves of stamina for the four-and-a-half-mile , 30-fence test which i like to see in my grand national hopes . shutthefrontdoor , the 2014 irish national winner , is also strong on that score . i like last year’s runner-up balthazar king and 2014 scottish national winner al co , as well as godsmejudge , second in that race having won it in 2013 . for those looking for an each-way punt at more speculative odds , royale knight is a horse which has caught my eye . i will be cheering on my two sons . tom rides soll , another runner with a serious chance of a light weight , while michael trains monbeg dude , last year’s seventh owned by a trio of rugby players including former england captain mike tindall . he could easily nick a place .
