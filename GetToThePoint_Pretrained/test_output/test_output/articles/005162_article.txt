' when i left wigan i always knew in my heart that i would return to play for the club one day and i am very excited at the thought of returning to the dw stadium and pulling on that famous jersey once again . ' i have really enjoyed my time in new zealand and ca n't thank everyone enough here as they have all done so much to make me feel welcome here since my arrival last year . ' my sole focus for the remainder of 2015 is to help the warriors make the play-offs as we look to mount a serious challenge for the nrl premiership . ' wigan coach shaun wane said : ' once i heard sam was looking to come back to england next year i knew we had to pull out all the stops to have him here . he is one of our own and a truly world-class player . ' sam knows what we are all about here at wigan . he understands our culture and our systems and will slot perfectly back into my squad .
