a taxi driver channelled his inner pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers . the uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in boston , america . at first the driver lets the radio take command and pavarotti’s distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab . at first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the pavarotti song in perfect tune . he then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road . while looking around as he drives , the uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly . the song then concludes with the video maker saying : ‘wow’ and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays . the passenger filming then says : ‘ wow , that was brilliant . thank you very much . ’ he then asks whether the man was singing along to pavarotti , to which the driver says yes . reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight . the passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along to the opera song word perfectly . later , the film maker wrote : ‘ we were heading out to meet some friends at a party in south boston and had a wonderful journey with the uber opera man . ’ luciano pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the three tenors . gaining worldwide fame for the tone of his voice , pavarotti made a number of televised concert performances . in 2007 , the tenor died from pancreatic cancer .
