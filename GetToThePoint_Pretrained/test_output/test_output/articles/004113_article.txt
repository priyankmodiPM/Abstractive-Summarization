' there was a child , a seven-year-old at home , she was upstairs , the commotion would not have been easy for her to ignore . the effect of the family dog would have been clear to her . each of you were either under the influence of alcohol or drugs . ' whilst you were there each of you knew the effect you were having on this couple and you continued in the way you did demanding money and pushing each of them around . '
