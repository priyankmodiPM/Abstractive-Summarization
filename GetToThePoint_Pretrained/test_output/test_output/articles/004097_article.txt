' wallace and ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately . both men used the drug pcp , according to attorneys and court documents , and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent , unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair . blame game : attorneys from the defense team said carlos ortiz , left , and ernest wallace , right , were responsible for the murder - not hernandez . dna and surveillance footage ties all three to the scene . support : shayanna jenkins ( left ) , hernandez 's girlfriend , and his mother terri listen to the judge on tuesday . emotional : an uncle of odin lloyd is comforted as he hears details about his nephew 's death on tuesday . investigators say lloyd was shot multiple times with a glock .45-caliber handgun that has not been found . sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony , prosecutors ' still have n't proved to you who killed odin lloyd .

' the investigation done in this case was incomplete , biased and inept . that was not fair to odin lloyd , that was not fair to aaron hernandez , and it was not fair to you , ' he said .
