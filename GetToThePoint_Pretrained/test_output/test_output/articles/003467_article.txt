' he 's just a class guy in every way and it 's difficult not to root for him , ' said golf legend phil mickelson . spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at augusta national . spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . spieth ( right ) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend annie . another legend impressed by spieth was jack nicklaus , who posted this tribute : ' congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man . that was an incredible performance . ' jordan is so beyond his years . i like everything about him . he 's polite , he 's humble , he handles himself so well , on and off the golf course . and he 's obviously a wonderful player and now a masters champion . ' the one family member who was n't present to enjoy the celebrations was jordan 's 14-year-old sister ellie , who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum . the siblings regularly facetime each other and every time they talk ellie asks he brother if he has won yet . ' i 'll finally be able to tell her yes , ' he said , smiling . ' i know she was watching on television and i think she 's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green , ' he said . ' she 's going to want a present . ' spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister ellie ( centre ) and brother steven ( right ) . spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . golf should not have been spieth 's game at all . nobody in the family plays â€” they are all big basketball fans . but spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there . when he set out he was ranked 809th in the world . now he is no 2 behind rory mcilroy . in 18 months , he has banked more than $ 13 million on the pga tour alone . in his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says : ' i do n't see this as a great run of form , i see this as normal , ' it does not come across as at all boastful . jesuit high school was recently in the news for all the wrong reasons when the daily mail online exposed former pupil , parker rice , as one of the oklahoma university students filmed conducting his sigma alpha epsilon brothers along in a racist chant on a bus last month .
