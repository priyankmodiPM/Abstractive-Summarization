' the celebrations in london will be echoed by other events across the country to mark ve day 70 , with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate .

' the announcement of the ve day celebrations came after the queen attended the traditional royal maundy service in sheffield yesterday . joined by the duke of edinburgh , her majesty , dressed in a turquoise coat by stewart parvin and matching hat , was there to present ' alms ' to 89 women and 89 men , among them d-day veteran , denis gratton . ' it was just quick . i 'm not very good at hearing , ' said mr gratton , 91 , after the ceremony . ' she did say something but i 'm not sure what it were . ' handing out alms : the queen presents a lady with the two maundy purses at sheffield cathedral . custom : monarchs have been presenting maundy money since 1210 and king john . the queen , who had arrived on the royal train , was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers . met at the church door by peter bradley , the dean of sheffield , and the local bishop , steven croft , her majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service . after the hour-long service , the queen posed for pictures with the yeoman of the guard , who had lined the cathedral 's aisles during the ceremony . the royal party then left for a reception at sheffield town hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine , all pleased with their royal acknowledgement . patricia durkin , 72 , said : ' it was brilliant , absolutely wonderful . when i got here the atmosphere was tremendous . ' the royal maundy service is one of the uk 's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins . this year , the red purse contains a £5 coin , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of winston churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the battle of britain . commemorative : the red and white bags contain commemorative coins , this year featuring winston churchill . tradition : the queen and prince philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . historically , this sum of £5.50 in the red purse is made up of £3 for clothing , £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the sovereign 's gown . the white purse contains uniquely minted maundy money , which , unlike coins in general circulation , bear the portrait of the queen produced by mary gillick at the start of her reign . gillick , a sculptor , designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the uk and some commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968 . the portrait of the queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation 's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years . the royal maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before good friday . warm welcome : the queen is greeted at sheffield cathedral ahead of the traditional royal maundy service . cheerful : the duke of edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . in an echo of the last supper , mediaeval and tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service . unlike the nosegay , which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell , that custom failed to survive the 18th century . the first monarch to take part in a maundy thursday service was king john , of magna carta and robin hood fame , who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in knaresborough in 1210 . john was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in rochester in 1213 . john 's grandson edward i , the king known to posterity as ' the hammer of the scots ' , was the first to confine the tradition to maundy thursday alone , which , until his reign , could be conducted on any day of the year . long wait : many of the well-wishers outside the cathedral had waited there for hours . modernising : the 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars ' feet - hence the nosegay . all smiles : the queen , who has only missed the ceremony four times , was all smiles as she arrived . smell : the scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people .
