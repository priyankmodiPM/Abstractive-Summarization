' we were doing a drill where , to score goals , we had to dribble between two poles which were sticking in the ground as gates . ' when i got to a set of poles john tackled me and one of the poles got stuck between my legs . ' it sounds stupid now but for banter i grabbed one of the poles and pretended i was doing some kind of ninja move . ' i threw it into the ground behind john who , by this point , was running away and facing in the other direction . ' but as i did that , he did a cruyff turn and the pole stabbed him in the leg . we were only a few feet apart . it was n't as if i launched it 10 metres like a javelin . he was right next to me . st mirren boss gary teale shakes hands with his captain thompson on the touchline at st mirren park .

' it popped in and out of his thigh instantly and for a few seconds his leg was black . but then blood started pouring out of the hole . ' john was obviously in agony . a few of us carried him inside and he got treatment . it was horrendous . ' i 've been shocked by it and really down . i like a laugh and a joke in training but for this to happen is just unbelievable . ' saturday was a big day for me but all i 'm thinking about is john .
