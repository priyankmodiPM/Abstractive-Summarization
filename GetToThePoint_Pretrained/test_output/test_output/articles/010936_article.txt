what would you get if one of the queen 's corgis ran off with one of sir ranulph fiennes 's siberian huskies and had a puppy ? a corgski , of course , just like max . at just 18.5in from foot to shoulder , this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter . he is , in fact , a fully grown husky-corgi cross . but , unbelievably , max has been abandoned and he 's looking for a home . he 's become a favourite with workers at the dogs trust in basildon , essex , who have been looking after him since he was found . max ( pictured ) is a 18.5in high fully-grown husky corgi cross . after being abandoned , he has now taken refuge at the dogs trust in basildon , essex . huskies , such as the one pictured , have become increasingly popular due to shows such as game of thrones . pictured is a typical welsh corgi . max is part corgi , part husky , and is looking for a new home . ' it quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages , ' says the trust 's sam davis . ' he caught the eye of our staff when he arrived , but as he was found as a stray , little is known about his life before . ' max is described as gentle , intelligent and big-hearted . there are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity 's network of animal rehousing centres . the trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of game of thrones and twilight , which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as alaskan malamutes and siberian huskies . but many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds – and make a lifetime commitment to them – resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned .
