' the secretary of defense and i will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one 's remains will be recovered , identified , and returned to you as expeditiously as possible , and we will do so with dignity , respect and care , ' deputy secretary of defense bob work said in a statement . ' while not all families will receive an individual identification , we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible . ' officials plan to begin the work in three to six weeks , morgan said . they aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years . in 2003 , the military disinterred one casket at the national memorial cemetery of the pacific based on information provided by ray emory , a pearl harbor survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents . loss of life : the uss oklahoma was hit with nine torpedoes in the assault , which caused the boat to tip over and capsize - trapping many inside . revenge : the oklahoma pictured above before the attack . overall , more than 2,000 americans died in the surprise attack on december 7 , 1941 which sparked the entrance of the u.s. into world war ii . watery grave : the capsized deck of the oklahoma is seen on may 24 , 1943 - two and a half years after the attack . rescue : after the ship capsized , survivors worked hard in an attempt to rescue some of those trapped inside . many remains were comingled when buried , and the military was able to identify five servicemen from that casket . but the coffin also contained the remains of up to 100 others who have n't been identified . ' it 's something i looked forward to for a long time , ' emory told cnn about tuesday 's news . the pentagon started notifying families on tuesday about the plans to disinter and identify the bodies . if a body is identified , the family will be notified and the sailor or marine 's remains returned to them for a full military burial . bob valley of escanaba , michigan was one of the first to hear about the plans . escanaba told the honolulu star advertiser that he received a call from the navy casualty office , about his brother lowell who died at the age of 19 on board the oklahoma . lowell worked in the boiler room on the port side of the ship , which was hit by japanese torpedos . the onslaught caused the ship to roll over and capsize - trapping much of the crew inside . ' i can hardly talk , ' valley , 82 , said of receiving the call . ' families want some kind of closure . ' valley says his parents received a telegram right before christmas 1941 , saying lowell was missing , and then another two months later saying he had died . ' and that 's all they ever got . they never got any information about punchbowl cemetery . they never heard of a punchbowl cemetery , ' valley said . valley said his parents tried hard to get information on where their son was buried , even seeking the help of a local congressmen . if identified , valley says he already has a burial plot ready for his brother .
