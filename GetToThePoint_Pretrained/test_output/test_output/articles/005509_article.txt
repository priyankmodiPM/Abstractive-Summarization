juventus striker carlos tevez has refuted claims suggesting he will rejoin boca juniors in the summer by insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future . tevez has said throughout his career that he wanted to end his career at his boyhood club but it appears the argentine outfit will have to wait for his signature . the 31-year-old 's future was thrown into doubt when boca juniors president daniel angelici claimed he was ' close to bringing carlos home ' despite tevez having another year on his current deal . juventus striker carlos tevez is yet to make a final decision on his future despite constant links to boca . talk of a return to his boyhood side intensified when tevez replicated his famous boca juniors celebration . tevez pulled off the ' chicken dance ' after scoring a crucial goal during boca 's 2-0 win over river plate in 2004 . and the link was made even stronger over the weekend as tevez celebrated his strike against lazio in a similar fashion to when he scored a vital goal for boca juniors against river plate back in 2004 . however tevez has thrown cold water over the ' chicken dance ' interpretation by telling sky sport italia : ' that game [ against river ] does not come into it . ' i celebrated like that because i promised my people that i would and i will do the same if i score against monaco [ on wednesday ] . ' as for my future , enough ! it 's not right to speak about me . juve are what count . ' both juve and i are going through an extraordinary moment and i 'm thinking only of juve right now . ' i do n't know if i will leave . i 've not yet decided what to do . ' but it 's not right to speak about it now and , as i said , the bianconeri fans will be the first to know what i decide . '
