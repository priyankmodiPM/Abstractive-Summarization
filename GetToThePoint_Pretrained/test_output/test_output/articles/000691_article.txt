( cnn ) '' hamlet . '' `` romeo and juliet . '' `` a midsummer night 's dream . '' for centuries , these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history 's most heralded literary canon . but now they may have to make room for an addition to shakespeare 's famous oeuvre . new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the `` newer '' play . `` the match between the ' double falsehood ' play and shakespeare was a landslide . it was shockingly clear , '' said ryan l. boyd , a researcher at the university of texas at austin . the study , co-authored by boyd and ut colleague james w. pennebaker , was published in the journal psychological science . `` there 's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently . '' boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher . only tiny traces of theobald 's signature were found . `` we 're certainly not suggesting that theobald did n't make edits , '' boyd told cnn . `` but he clearly did not write it . '' `` double falsehood , '' also known as `` the distressed lovers , '' is based on the `` cardenio '' section of don quixote , the classic 17th-century novel by miguel de cervantes . set in spain , the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers : one virtuous , one sinful . theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered , all of them written by shakespeare . but many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake , suspecting that theobald tried to pass the bard 's work off as his own . shakespeare , who died in 1616 , wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612 . british publishers arden shakespeare published `` double falsehood '' in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was shakespeare 's work . but the new study by boyd and pennebaker , the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective , may settle the matter once and for all . shakespearean scholar brean hammond , professor of modern english literature at nottingham university in the uk , praised the texas study for its scientific approach . hammond said boyd and pennebaker `` have got no dogs in the fight . they 're not literary scholars , ( so ) their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies . '' hammond studied `` double falsehood 's '' authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found shakespeare 's dna evident in the play . but he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest . `` those people who do n't believe the play was written by shakespeare are n't going to just lay down and die , '' he said .
