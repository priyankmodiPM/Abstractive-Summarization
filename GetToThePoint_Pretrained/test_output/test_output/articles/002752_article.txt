men do almost twice the amount of housework after they retire - but they are still doing far less than their wives , according to new research . the study of 1,302 german couples found working men did just two hours of house work each day , which almost doubled to 3.9 hours when they retired . but they are still lagging behind their stay-at-home female partners when it comes to sharing the burden . division of labour : men do just two hours of housework a day while working , which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives . the study , published in the journal of marriage and family , found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband 's retired . chores included doing the laundry and the washing up , as well as running errands , according to new york magazine . however , the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired . what 's more , it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up , even post-retirement . the research noted the increase in the men 's hours was mainly taken up by more ' manly ' chores - like repairs and gardening . however , the study - conducted by thomas leopold at the university of amsterdam and jan skopek at the european university institute - does not reveal how the burden was shared when both the husband and wife were working . manly : the men were also less likely to do the ' female ' chores , sticking to gardening and repairs .
