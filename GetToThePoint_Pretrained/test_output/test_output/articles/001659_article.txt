haul : the cherry picker collecting drugs from the roof of hmp altcourse in liverpool . the amount of drugs being thrown over the fence into one prison is so high that warders have been forced to deploy a cherry picker to remove them . packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of hmp altcourse in liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets . the hydraulic crane also recovered so-called ' legal highs ' as well as 22 phones , three sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof , contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages . officers at the jail , privately run by controversial firm g4s , disclosed the haul in an internal document , which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail 's 1,300 inmates . dave thompson , director of the category b prison , said : ' these items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops . ' altcourse , the first prison in the uk to be designed and constructed for a private operator , has been criticised for drug-related violence . after a three-day visit last june , chief inspector of prisons chris hardwick wrote : ' there have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection . gang issues and the availability of drugs , particularly new psychoactive substances [ legal highs ] were a significant factor in much of the violence . ' g4s insists that altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation , and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility ' approach to show inmates they will ' root out packages from anywhere ' . ' we are committed to preventing drugs coming into our prison and we are encouraged that , at the same time as our seizures of banned substances have increased , the numbers of prisoners testing positive for them has come down , ' said mr thompson .
