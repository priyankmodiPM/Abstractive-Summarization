' however he was found guilty of robbery and assault , following a trial held at maidstone crown court . detective constable kathryn lumsden-earle , of kent police , said : ' dew took advantage of a so-called friend 's generosity , taking his phone and then never returning it . ' he then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet . ' he did all of this in the victim 's own home , which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety . ' time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day , but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend . ' dew , 26 , was found guilty of robbery and assault by a jury at maidstone crown court ( pictured ) .
