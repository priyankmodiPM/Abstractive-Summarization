everton manager roberto martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after ross barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against burnley at goodison park . the untried barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by david jones on aaron lennon – rather than leighton baines , who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the premier league . although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time , it brought back memories of everton 's match against west brom in january when kevin mirallas grabbed the ball from baines to take a penalty - and missed . ross barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of leighton baines on the pitch . barkley 's effort is saved by burnley goalkeeper tom heaton at goodison park . martinez insisted barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on saturday .

' ross showed incredible responsibility to take it . i love seeing players take control of the big moments and leighton was happy to given him that responsibility . ' barkley 's penalty was well-struck but was n't put in the corner and burnley goalkeeper tom heaton dived to his right to save . fortunately for the young england player , it did n't prove costly as mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes . everton boss roberto martinez issues instructions to his players during a break in play against burnley .
