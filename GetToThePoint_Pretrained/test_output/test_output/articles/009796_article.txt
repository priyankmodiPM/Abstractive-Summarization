a new york judge has granted two chimpanzees held at a research lab the same rights as human prisoners , after a two year legal battle by an animal rights organization . the two primates , currently living in a lab at stony brook university , are the first animals in history to be covered by a writ of habeas corpus , allowing their detention to be challenged . a representative of the long island university have been ordered to appear in court to respond to a petition by the nonhuman rights project that chimps hercules and leo are ' unlawfully detained . ' making history : the two chimpanzees , living in a lab at stony brook university , long island , ( not pictured ) are the first animals to be granted the same rights as human prisoners . the decision by new york supreme court justice barbara jaffe effectively recognises the chimpanzees as legal humans , the american association for the advancement of science reports . the lawsuits were originally filed by the nonhuman rights project in december 2013 , in an attempt to free hercules and leo and two other chimpanzees living on private property . although the courts threw out the suits , the animal rights ' group has been appealing ever since , and have now been granted the writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the stony brook chimpanzees . a stony brook representative have been ordered to appear in court next month to respond the petition which argues that the chimps should be set free and moved to a sanctuary in florida . ' we are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous , ' the nonhuman rights project 's founder massachusetts lawyer steven wise said in an interview last year . a representative of the university have been ordered to appear in a new york court next month to respond the petition which argues that leo and hercules should be set free and moved to a sanctuary ( stock image ) . ' that is , being able to self-determine , be self-aware , and be able to choose how to live their own lives . ' the 2013 lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities , such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices , and display complex emotions such as empathy . although judge jaffe 's ruling only requires a stony brook university representative to attend a hearing regarding hercules and leo next month , it can be used to set precedent for further legal action . ' this is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking : the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals , ' natalie prosin , the executive director of the nonhuman rights project ( nhrp ) told the aaas . ' we got our foot in the door . and no matter what happens , that door can never be completely shut again . '
