' he has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best i 've seen even though he is young . ' for me , there 's not a player of the same age near him . ' kane took his tally of goals to 30 for the season with this strike against newcastle last sunday . butland hopes kane can fire the young lions to european championship glory this summer . butland was part of the ill-fated england side that crashed out of the under 21 finals at the group stages two years ago , though he did help the under 17s win their european championship in 2010 . he said : ' with no world cup or olympics , it 's a chance to grab peoples attention and show there is hope if you like and that there are good players coming through . ' with the incredibly gifted players we have in this country , we need to produce at a higher level . players like myself , nathaniel chalobah and nathan redmond experienced tournament football and won it with the under 17s and that should help massively . kane has declared that he wants to play in the tournament in the czech republic this summer . ' it can bring a calming influence to the group , we will be able to to give a few words of advice here and there and give people an idea of what to expect . ' it is unusual for a goalkeeper to be captain but dino zoff ( 1982 ) and casillas ( 2010 ) led their country to world cup wins . ' i dreamed of winning the trophy in the last tournament but it did n't go well then . the motivation has been even stronger to produce something this time as a team and do ourselves proud . butland wants to emulate spain goalkeeper iker casillas by captaining his side to tournament glory . ' it has to be the dream , and to lift the trophy would be a huge honour . casillas has done it , as a spain captain he has lifted everything . whether i was captain or not , lifting the trophy would be incredible . ' england 's squad for the finals will be announced on june 2 . their first match is on june 18 .
