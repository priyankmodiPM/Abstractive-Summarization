it is important to remember that everyone is different , says camilla , and there 's no normal time to resume your sex life . a survey carried out by nct.org.uk has shown that 29 per cent of women had resumed sex within a month of their baby’s birth , and almost 60 per cent within eight weeks . this left 40 per cent who took longer , with a further three per cent of women who took over a year . the most important thing is to wait until you are physically and emotionally ready . experts recommend starting with low impact exercises such as pilates to help rebuild muscles . take your return to exercise slow . hormones during pregnancy and breast feeding may put you at increased risk of injury . the hormone relaxin increases the flexibility of your soft tissues and joints , and can remain in the body for up to six months after delivery , making you prone to joint strains or sprains . the hormones produced when breast feeding can also have an effect on your soft tissues which is why it is important to really build up your muscle strength and core stability before you return to high impact exercise like running or aerobics . start with low impact exercise . this will address the areas that you will be weak in such as your core ( including tummy muscles ) , your back and glutes . try to leave six weeks after your delivery ( or up to eight weeks after a c-section ) before starting low-impact cardio exercise such as swimming or using a cross trainer . accompanying this with core-strengthening and conditioning work such as postnatal pilates and light weights will help you rebuild muscles . according to women 's weekly zara tindall claims she got her post-baby body thanks to 'weight-training ' runs by pushing newborn mia in her buggy . hold off on high impact exercise for three months . you can go back to being a gym-bunny says camilla , but advises that you first optimise your core strength and control before re-starting high-impact exercise , such as jogging , running , aerobics or team sports . ensure you are pain free before gradually getting back to this around three months after delivery . the duchess of cambridge was n't spotted doing exercise until she took part in a volley ball match three months after george 's birth . zara tindall claims that pushing mia in her buggy was enough to help her achieve her post-baby body .
