' if you said choose one to live or die , i would n't be able too ... like i love them equally . ' but alex has a smell that he 's had since he was born . i sniff him all the time . there 's some sort of smell connection . ' the insight programme is based on research of modern families which shows sibling interactions can have a vital role in teaching children valuable social and life skills , as well as in shaping personality and behaviour . but , the programme researchers said , siblings also routinely get stuck into each other . ' parents may see this rivalry as part and parcel of the sibling experience , however there is a growing body of research that links early sibling aggression with serious ongoing learning and mental health problems , ' insight says . amie cox says five-year-old alex ( left ) who has the special smell which she appreciates because of the science of pheromones is ' a terror ' while his brother william , 7 ( centre ) is more easygoing but both boys get the same amount of toys and love and she is a normal mother despite being attacked online as ' a freak ' . the 33-year-old said attacks on her for admitting she is very attracted to her younger son 's scent are ' water off a duck 's back ' and that ' it does n't bother me ' because she is a good mother who gives her older son william just as many hugs as she does alex . ' are such disputes unavoidable , and do tensions always persist into adulthood ? ' insight asks ' if competition and conflict between siblings is a good thing , and whether favouritism can affect this . ' ms cox told daily mail australia that she treats her sons equally and that her older son william also has appreciation for alex 's scent . ' william has the same smell connection with alex as i do , ' she said . ' it 's about the science behind pheromones . ' they were on the couch the other day and william said `` alex , is n't his skin so soft and he smells so nice '' and of course alex said get off me . ' alex is the terror . he 's feisty and opinionated like me , while william is well behaved very easygoing and has a different personality . ' they still fight , but there 's nothing vicious or violent about it . ' they are like puppies or tiger cubs . they 're rowdy , but they 're not particularly competitive . ' the program also explores how this plays out in families from a culture where there is a hierarchical or gender preference . guests , sisters jen paull and melanie colwell described how their perceptions of who was the family favourite affected their relationship with their parents . ' i 'd describe her as a role model to me . i grew up basically wanting everything that she had , ' ms paull said of her sister . ' i don’t think my parents knew how good they had it until they had jenny , ' said ms colwell . brothers nick and tom inatey said their relationship growing up was not competitive . ' we 're not the two that are going to go out in the backyard and beat one or the other at . spor , ' nick said of tom , saying his brother was ' hopeless ' at sport . tom readily agreed , ' absolutely . that 's very true . ' celia harrison , who is the mother of twins said of her children , 'they’ll compete about who’s got the most cereal in a bowl and they’re measuring glasses to make sure someone doesn’t have more milk that the other one ' . insight : siblings showdown - tuesday 7 april , 8.30pm , repeat wednesday 3.30pm on sbs one .
