the name gary - once one of the most popular name in britain - is now heading for extinction . just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows . that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain . in 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 . all in a name : others suggest that gary lineker , left , or take that singer barlow might have put some off . helped by the popularity of actor gary cooper , there was a surge in garys born in the us in the early 1950s . there was even a trend of girls being given the name . the name peaked in britain roughly decade later . in 1964 , it was ranked 16th most popular . since then , there has been a fall in the number of garys . it is now among a number of once-common names that are close to dying-out completely . fall from grace : some blame shamed pop star gary glitter , pictured , for the name 's declining popularity . there has been suggestion that football pundit lineker , or take that singer barlow might have put some off the name . but others point to britain 's most notorious gary , paedophile pop star glitter , who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls , as the reason behind the name 's fall from grace . speaking to the sun , gary davis , from south london , said : ' gary glitter has obviously done us no favours . ' between 1996 and 2013 , unusual names such as dexter ( there were 1,019 born in 2013 ) , jenson ( 1,055 ) and harley ( 1,275 ) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100 . meanwhile , the country went from having no girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . nearly 200 were born in 2013 . other names inspired by famous faces including rihanna ( 60 born in 2013 ) , hermione ( 77 ) and paris ( 107 ) were also more popular than humble gary . data from last year shows a surge in arabic names in the uk , with omar , ali and ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time . for girls , maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35 , while nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100 , jumping straight to number 29 . and muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys . sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was maryam , while the highest new entries were nur , emilia and gracie . for baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . the highest new entry was kian . popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . above , harper with her brothers and father last month . girls . alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it’s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . it dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor . nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . but today , most parents say no to nanette . sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . sondra - sandra’s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . but the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . boys . elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . his name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . inigo - inigo is another name that’s never ranked here , though it’s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . it’s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . but despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . but the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson’s heyday , but it hasn’t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . waldo - where’s waldo ? he’s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .
