bristol city will become the first football league club to win promotion this season should they beat bradford on tuesday night . the league one leaders managed to come away from second-placed preston north end unscathed , drawing 1-1 thanks to aaron wilbraham’s equaliser after jermaine beckford had opened the scoring just before the hour . regardless , steve cotterill’s side had been destined not to seal promotion at deepdale because results elsewhere didn’t go their way . bristol city manager steve cotterill was happy to avoid defeat against preston on saturday . three points at bradford on tuesday will do the trick . it would take something to go seriously awry for the robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence , and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west . ‘that’ll be good , ’ cotterill said . ‘we’ll digest that and try and prepare properly for the game . ‘ it was important not to get beat here . if you look at it , if we had and then got nothing at bradford ( on tuesday ) then we’re stuck on 88 points . preston would’ve gone to 83 points today and then have gillingham at home . ‘ you always look at the worst case scenario . ’ bristol city’s elevation to the second tier appears a formality , and preston remain in pole position to join them . nevertheless , manager simon grayson has warned his players not to get carried away . ‘we’ve said to the players we can only influence our own games , but it’s another point to our tally and another game chalked off , ’ he said . ‘ but there will be no complacency from the team , we know we have to keep working . ’ cotterill , meanwhile , has always gunned for the league one title rather than just promotion and this result preserved their eight-point lead over preston , although they have played a game more . his squad are staying in a nearby hotel until the trip to valley parade and will train at burnley in preparation .
