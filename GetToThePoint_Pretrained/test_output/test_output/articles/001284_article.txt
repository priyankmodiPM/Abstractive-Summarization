scott dann was a fraction offside when he set up glenn murray for palace’s first goal ( 2 ) , but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant john brooks . he was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before dann got the ball ( 1 ) and for murray’s finish ( 3 ) . the speed of it , plus two players blocking his view , made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right .
