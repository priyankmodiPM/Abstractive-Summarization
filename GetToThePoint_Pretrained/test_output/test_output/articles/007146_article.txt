the first high-resolution footage of solar flux ropes on the sun has been revealed . in the fascinating video , twisting groups of magnetic fields can be seen writhing around . and with the new images it may be possible to further understand their evolution and how they cause space weather . research led by a scientist at the new jersey institute of technology has revealed the first high-resolution footage of a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun , shown in this still image . the new footage was revealed in a paper in nature communications led by dr haimin wang from the new jersey institute of technology . a solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage , which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun . they are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres . as common structures in the solar corona , they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather - including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . the formation of a flux rope can take weeks , but the moment when it is flung into the atmosphere can take just a matter of hours . solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost . astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission . they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks . the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the earth 's magnetic field . very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies . a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced . geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents . in the video , twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis , and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form , shown here . dr wang and his colleagues made the findings using the 5.2ft ( 1.6 metres ) new solar telescope at the big bear solar observatory in california . they describe an s-shaped bundle of magnetic fields , from which a set of loops peel off and grow upward into a multi-stranded flux rope in just two minutes . two flare ribbons also appear at the point where the rope joins the solar atmosphere . it is hoped the study , which shows a flux rope in unprecedented detail , could help increase understanding on how they form - and how they are related to solar eruptions . ‘ in the large scale , magnetic flux ropes are found in the interplanetary magnetic clouds , which may interact with earth’s magnetic field to generate geomagnetic storms , ’ the researchers wrote in their paper . solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona , and they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather – including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured .
