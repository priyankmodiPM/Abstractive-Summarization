[ somewhere ] you do n't really get a look-in . i always back myself and no matter what step i take next i want to do well . ' one thing i do want next year no matter where i am – and i do n't know where that is going to be – is to work with a manager who is going to coach me and really develop me as a player . that 's all you can ask for , to learn and be the best you can be . it is important that you do get football . a lot of other things can suck you in when it comes to moves and i am sure that it has happened in the past to people . my main aim next year is , wherever i am , to play football and to enjoy it and develop . ' you do n't want to have a good couple of years , come through the championship , have a good first year in the premier league and then not play in the premier league for another year or so because that is a backward step . no matter what contract anyone is on it is important that you are playing football . it is a short career and you have to earn a living but at the same time playing football is the best way to get better contracts anyway . that 's the way i look at things .
