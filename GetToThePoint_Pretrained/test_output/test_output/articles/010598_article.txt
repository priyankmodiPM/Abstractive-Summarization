michael carrick 's outstanding second-half performance for england against italy on tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the three lions behind sir stanley matthews . carrick made his england debut against mexico in may 2001 as a teenager with west ham united and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to euro 2016 , he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary sir stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years . matthews won his 54 england caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957 , interrupted of course by the second world war . michael carrick 's appearance for england against italy on tuesday night keeps him in the longest-serving list . carrick has played for england for 13 years , 310 days - while sir stanley matthews reached 22 years , 228 days . sir stanley runs with the ball in action for england against brazil at wembley in an international friendly . stanley matthews ( 1934-57 ) 22 yrs , 228 days . peter shilton ( 1970-90 ) 19 yrs , 224 days . frank lampard ( 1999-2014 ) 14 yrs , 257 days . steven gerrard ( 2000-2014 ) 14 yrs , 23 days . david seaman ( 1988-2002 ) 13 yrs , 335 days . michael carrick ( 2001- ) 13 yrs , 310 days . ... and the legends he overtook . david beckham ( 1996-2009 ) – 13 yrs , 43 days . sir bobby charlton ( 1958-70 ) 12 yrs , 23 days . bobby moore ( 1962-73 ) 11 yrs , 178 days . gary lineker ( 1984-1992 ) 8 yrs , 22 days . carrick was hailed by manchester united team-mate wayne rooney as ' the best player on the pitch by a mile ' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in turin and helped roy hodgson 's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw . his longevity already surpasses that of great names like sir bobby charlton , bobby moore , david beckham and gary lineker and if he continues to play in the next european championship he will overtake steven gerrard and frank lampard too . the only player to have had a longer career since matthews is goalkeeper peter shilton who played for england between 1971 and 1990 . it also begs the question why carrick , who has won four premier league titles and the champions league with manchester united , has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments . he played once at the 2006 world cup in a 1-0 victory against ecuador , was in the squad but never played by fabio capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in south africa , and was n't even selected by roy hodgson last year in brazil , even though england 's perennial problem has been keeping the ball . with rooney now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder , it seems unlikely carrick will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves . the 33-year-old may still have a few years left but remains a long way off sir stanley 's record . carrick ( left ) pictured with england team-mates raheem sterling ( centre ) and danny welbeck ( right ) . vs italy , march 31 , 2015 . vs lithuania , mar 27 , 2015 . vs poland , october 15 , 2013 . vs montenegro , october 11 , 2013 . vs brazil , june 2 , 2013 . vs ireland , may 29 , 2013 . vs montenegro , march 26 , 2013 . vs poland , october 17 , 2012 . vs san marino , october 12 , 2012 . vs moldova , september 12 , 2012 . vs italy , august 15 , 2012 . vs mexico , may 24 , 2010 . vs egypt , march 3 , 2010 . vs ukraine , october 10 , 2009 . vs slovenia , september 5 , 2009 . vs holland , august 12 , 2009 . vs slovakia , march 28 , 2009 . vs spain , february 11 , 2009 . vs germany , november 19 , 2008 . vs germany , august 22 , 2007 . vs brazil , june 1 , 2007 . vs spain , february 7 , 2007 . vs holland , november 15 , 2006 . vs croatia , october 11 , 2006 . vs macedonia , october 7 , 2006 . vs macedonia , september 6 , 2006 . vs ecuador , june 25 , 2006 . vs jamaica , june 3 , 2006 . vs uruguay , march 1 , 2006 . vs colombia , may 31 , 2005 . vs usa , may 28 , 2005 . vs holland , august 15 , 2001 . vs mexico , may 25 , 2001 .
