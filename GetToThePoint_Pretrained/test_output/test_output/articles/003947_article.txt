' the club will be making no further comment on the matter . ' his solicitor , liam o'donnell , told the court that social work reports ' finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending . he added : ' he was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23 . at age 23 he separated from his partner . the reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem . the 27-year-old dundee midfielder pictured in action against dundee united last week . ' this gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending . when he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression . ' o'donnell revealed the former st mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the paisley-based rca trust , which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions . ' he is fully supported by his club , ' he added . ' the managing director of dundee football club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters . ' after listening to the address , sheriff o'carroll reminded mcgowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences , in 2010 and 2013 . ' and here you are again facing similar charges , ' o'carroll added . ' it 's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that 's in the thoughts of the court . ' however , he proceeded to sentence mcgowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling . ' if you breach the order you will be brought back here and i have already advised you what the outcome will be , ' the sheriff added . dundee managing director john nelms , who was accompanied in court by players including captain james mcpake , declined to answer questions outside court . mcgowan also declined to comment but o'donnell said afterwards : ' he is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour . he appreciates the support of his club and others .
