tottenham defender ben davies will allow no room for sentiment up against wales team-mate sam vokes at burnley on sunday . spurs head to turf moor looking to sustain a decent run following just one defeat , at manchester united , from four barclays premier league matches before the international break as they look to keep alive hopes of european qualification . burnley , meanwhile , are scrapping for survival , currently 18th , but just a point from safety . burnley 's sam vokes celebrates scoring against tottenham in the fa cup earlier this season , with spurs defender ben davies turning away following the clarets ' equaliser in the third round at turf moor . davies chases a loose ball for tottenham along with chelsea 's willian earlier this season in a barclays premier league clash at stamford bridge which the blues won 3-0 . clarets forward vokes and full-back davies were part of the wales team which beat israel 3-0 in their euro 2016 qualifying tie . however , davies maintains there can be no quarter given should he get the chance of a first spurs appearance since the 2-1 win at qpr . ' i have played alongside sam with wales for a good couple of years now and it is always strange coming up against somebody who is normally a team-mate , but regardless of that burnley is a tough place to go , ' davies said on tottenham 's official website . ' burnley are a well-organised team and they can make it very difficult for their opponents . they have taken points off some big teams this year , so we need to go there and make sure that we are focused and be wary of the threats that they have got . ' with points at a premium at both ends of the table , davies knows what is at stake over the run-in . sam vokes attempts to fire a shot in on goal for wales as israel 's tal ben haim lunges in during saturday 's euro 2016 qualifier in haifa . davies was also part of the wales team which triumphed in israel ( right ) as he slides in to block a cross . ' everybody is fighting for something . every team needs the points at this stage of the season and they want to win every game they can , ' the defender added . ' it is going to be no different on sunday . we are going there and we have got to be ready to match their challenge . ' dutch goalkeeper michel vorm is set to deputise for hugo lloris , who has a knee injury . full-back danny rose will be assessed after returning early from an england call-up with hamstring and hip issues . spurs had some 13 players away on senior international duty , with striker harry kane again impressing for the three lions , scoring on his debut against lithuania at wembley , while andros townsend netted an equaliser against italy in turn on tuesday night , when midfielder ryan mason made his bow . manager mauricio pochettino believes the squad can take that positive mood back into domestic duty . he said : ' it has been a very good week for tottenham . the english players and others with their international teams have put in good performances . they are all fit and at a very good level too . ' it is always difficult after the international break , but we need to make it a good performance and win the game . '
