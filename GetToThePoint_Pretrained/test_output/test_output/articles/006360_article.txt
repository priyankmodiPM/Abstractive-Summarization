' and away from sport , hbo , which will broadcast mayweather vs pacquiao in america alongside showtime , issued take down notices last week after the season five premiere of hit show game of thrones was streamed . ' we are aware of periscope and have sent takedown notices , ' an hbo spokeswoman said in a statement . ' in general , we feel developers should have tools which proactively prevent mass copyright infringement from occurring on their apps and not be solely reliant upon notifications . ' the wbc title belt that will be presented to either pacquiao or mayweather at the mgm grand next saturday . periscope has come under fire after the new series of hbo 's game of thrones was shared online . periscope allows users to stream live video from their phones to their twitter accounts with the click of a button . the live streams can be filmed on iphones and ipads and watched through smartphones , desktops or laptops either through the app or on twitter 's site . periscope saves the video streams once you are finished , so that they can be viewed for up to 24 hours - while rival meerkat 's live video disappears once you choose the broadcast to end . existing twitter users can download the app via the app store for free before being offered the option of subscribing to their followers ' periscope broadcasts . click here to read periscope 's terms of service . periscope ' lets you share and experience live video from your mobile phone ' and is ' a perfect complement to twitter , which is why we acquired the company in january , ' twitter 's kevin weil said in a blog post . ' it may sound crazy , but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation , ' claim the periscope team . ' while there are many ways to discover events and places , we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through live video . ' however , its terms of service claims it does not support copyright infringement , but currently relies on reports from users alerting the company to the infringement . ' we respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect periscope users to do the same , ' the tos read . ' we will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us . ' the company has a team dedicated to content review , has the right to remove any illegal content and shut down a person 's account if they are found to be violating the tos . one possible precedent is the use of another app , vine , which allows users to upload six-second clips . the premier league was last year forced to remind people not to post copyrighted material after fans started recording goals and sharing them with their friends over social media - with many unaware that what they were doing was illegal . the most popular vine football accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers , despite twitter stating : ' vine users may not post content that violates the rights of a third party . ' mayweather ( left ) trains with his uncle roger during a media workout in las vegas . in an interview with the bbc , director communications dan johnson said : ' you can understand that fans see something , they can capture it , they can share it , but ultimately it is against the law . ' ' it 's a breach of copyright and we would discourage fans from doing it , we 're developing technologies like gif crawlers , vine crawlers , working with twitter to look to curtail this kind of activity . ' he added : ' i know it sound as if we 're killjoys but we have to protect our intellectual property . ' pacquiao takes on the pads with trainer freddie roach in front of the watching media . meanwhile , meerkat , which allows users to turn their mobile phones into a portable webcam that lets them live stream whatever their handset is pointing towards , has had its access to some twitter services cut . twitter was not impressed when the app imported all of the user 's followers and details of who they were following and have limited meerkat 's access , although the company has since has found a way around this by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite twitter users . founder ben rubin claims that while other live video services had been available before , they did not take off because of a lack of network capacity and enough people using smartphones for video . ' this truly feels like a beginning of a new era , ' elman said . premier league goals and highlights are already being made illegally available as vine posts . nonetheless , periscope and meerkat may not immediately threaten to steal sports broadcasters profits , but they serve as a form of ' grass roots competition , ' said john vrooman , a vanderbilt university sports economist , told cnbc . ' streaming apps that allow simultaneous media consumption and production are not in themselves a clear and present danger to sports leagues , ' he added . the biggest problem is that watching streamed video from a mobile phone can be a frustrating experience with quality far removed from modern high-definition tv screens -not to mention pop up ads , potential viruses , picture freezes and buffering . a twitter spokesperson told sportsmail : ' periscope will review all reported broadcasts against its content policy , which expressly prohibits the broadcast of copyright-protected material . ' after investigation , periscope will take down any reported streams that are deemed to infringing . users who are found to be repeat infringers may face account suspension or termination . ' broadcasters showtime and hbo in the us and sky in the uk have bought the rights to the fight , meaning that anyone who streams it in the respective countries will be breaching their copyright . individual users may have a legal defence if they show small parts of the fight with credit on their periscope stream , but showing it in its entirety would be illegal . the copyright holders would be entitled to bring legal action against those in breach . however , due to ephemeral nature of periscope - if users choose not to save their broadcast - and the difficulties in tracking down individuals , the likelihood is that broadcasters would choose to bring a lawsuit against periscope for facilitating the breach of copyright . at the beginning of the 2014/15 season , the premier league warned social media users that it was illegal to share clips from games , and claimed it was developing technology to sift through millions of vines and gifs to target those in breach . last week hbo in the us issued takedown notices to twitter , which owns periscope , over the illegal streaming of the season premiere of game of thrones . in its terms of service , periscope encourages anyone with a copyright complaint to come to them , with evidence of the breach . it also states : ' we reserve the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion . in appropriate circumstances , periscope will also terminate a user 's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer .
