' earnest was referring to the allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct at the dea , the fbi , the u.s . marshals service and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives that were examined in a march report by the justice department 's inspector general . in a case study , the inspector general said dea 's internal affairs office in 2009 and 2010 received allegations from ' former host-country police officers ' that several dea agents , including senior supervisors , had ' solicited prostitutes and engaged in other serious misconduct ' while stationed in the unnamed country . u.s. officials said the country was colombia . the report said that ' sex parties ' financed by ' local drug cartels ' took place over ' several years ' inside offices leased by the dea . a dea supervisor told the inspector general 's office that it was ' common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers . ' the inspector general 's report also said ' prostitutes in the agents ' quarters could easily have had access to sensitive dea equipment and information . ' it did not explicitly allege that such materials had been compromised to traffickers . from left to right : leonhart , justice department inspector general michael horowitz and fbi associate deputy director kevin perkins are sworn in to testify . leonhart said there was ' no evidence ' that sensitive information had been leaked but it 's ' absolutely ' possible that information had been compromised . the house oversight aide who spokes to reuters said the committee 's leaks inquiry would examine the bureaucratic culture and leadership at the dea and other justice department investigative agencies . the events with prostitutes took place between 2001 and 2005 , but u.s. officials said the dea did not investigate them until years later . leonhart has also been accused by the inspector general of not giving out stiff enough penalties for misconduct . supplemented by two u.s. government reports , leonhart 's testimony raised concern among the committee 's members that agents might have leaked secrets about their investigations that found their way to the colombian drug lords . ' it is incredibly concerning that , according to the dea itself , there is a clear possibility that information was compromised as a result of these sex parties , ' elijah cummings , the committee 's top democrat , told reuters . he described the dea agents ' actions as ' truly breathtaking recklessness ' in a statement . the panel 's members issued a statement after leonhart 's appearance saying she had ' lost the confidence ' of the committee . leonhart ' has been woefully unable to change or positively influence the pervasive “ good old boy” culture that exists throughout the agency , ' they said of the second woman to hold the job . ' from her testimony , it is clear that she lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their position , ' the group of 22 republican and democratic members of congress wrote . oversight committee officials disclosed to reuters excerpts from a once-confidential internal dea report which quoted an agency informant alleging that u.s. agents who took part in the parties had compromised sensitive information . one informant , identified by the committee as ' cooperator 2 , ' was quoted in an excerpt from the dea report alleging that he believed a second informant ( ' cooperator 1 ' ) had ' gained information from the u.s. agents by ' getting their guard down ' through the use of prostitutes and paying for parties . ' the report says cooperator 1 ' bragged about the parties with prostitutes and how he ' sold ' the relationship/closeness with the agents ' to cooperator 2 . according to the report , cooperator 1 also ' stated he could easily get the agents to talk .
