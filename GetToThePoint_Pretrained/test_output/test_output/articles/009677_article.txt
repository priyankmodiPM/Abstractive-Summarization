selfie sticks and extreme sports are not designed to go together , as a snowboarder in japan proved . while enjoying the slopes in the country’s chiisagata district , the man can be seen decked out in purple holding a matching selfie stick at arm’s length . recording himself from behind , the man begins his descent of the mountain and a skier can be seen just in front of him . weaving down the slope , the snowboarder initially appears to make a success of the video and he even causes the snow to spray in the air while turning . picking up the speed , the man heads in the direction of the chairlifts before moving away again – adjusting his selfie stick to capture himself from the front in the process . but as the confident snowboarder adjusts the camera , he is oblivious to the chairlift swinging into view behind . the snowboarder , in a bright purple jacket , is using a selfie stick to film himself in action . the show-off stops to clear some snow off the screen of the camera , not realising what is about to happen . it is later explained online that there was too much snow and that the chairlift was therefore lower to the ground than it would normally be . as the snowboarder in the purple jacket turns to his companion and appears to talk , the empty chairlift deals him a heavy blow to the head . and the final indignity sees the boarder fall to the ground while still filming himself . the snowboarder can be heard making a scream as he holds the back of his head and falls to the floor . realising his mistake , the snowboarder concludes the video by shuffling himself out of the way and sitting beside the chairlift as another passes safely by . the empty chairlift appears out of nowhere and clatters the snowboarder over the head . and the final indignity sees the snowboarder fall to the ground while still filming himself .
