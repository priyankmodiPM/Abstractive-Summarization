japan 's j-league is just four games into a new season , but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent 's face . videos of the south korean defender kim min hyeok , who plays for sagan tosu , have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent mu kanazaki . sagan are ninth in the j-league and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed kashima antlers player kanazaki . kim min hyeok ( left ) and mu kanazaki ( right ) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a j-league clash . after kanazaki went down , it is alleged that hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent . despite the vicious looking nature of hyeok’s apparent attack and kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face , the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on , much to the fans ' uproar . whether or not the foul was intentional , it is suspected that the reason for japanese fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself , but the fact that it was committed by a south korean player . hyeok 's boot appears to scrape down kanazaki 's face , but the man on the floor came out as the winner later . hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium . some japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of hyeok , but of all south koreans , from the game . however , regardless of the controversy , justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1 , with kanazaki among the goals .
