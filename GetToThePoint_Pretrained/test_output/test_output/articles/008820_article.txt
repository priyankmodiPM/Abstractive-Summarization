james collins can rest easy . as sensational an own goal as his inadvertently precise lob over adrian was in west ham 's 2-0 defeat at manchester city , it was not the weekend 's most bizarre . not by a long way . that honour falls to mohammad shatnawi of jordanian club al faisaly , whose effort will be considered as one of the strangest own goals ever . his team were 1-0 down against al whidat in the amman derby when their opponents pushed forward , looking to double their lead . video - scroll down to see mohammad shatnawi 's amazing own goal . mohammed shatnawi bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend . shatnawi appeared to be trying to put the ball out of play after initially making a good save . he watches on in horror as the ball floats ominously towards the net after his overhead kick . as the al whidat striker closed in on goal and lashed a venomous strike on target , shatnawi got down well to stop it with his foot , an impulsive reaction block . but what happened next , as the ball looped up in the air , is inexplicable . perhaps shatnawi did not realise he had as much time as he did to collect the rebound . maybe he thought what he was about to do was the best way to eliminate any impending danger . or maybe he even mistook his team-mates for opponents . west ham 's james collins ( right ) accidentally lobbed his goalkeeper trying to clear a cross on sunday . shatnawi kept his eyes on the ball , leaned back , raised his right leg and kicked it over his head , one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner . instead , his touch was a little too cushioned , and the ball drifted nonchalantly into his own net .
