a motorway police patrol pulled over a car on suspicion of attempting to go back in time . officers of the central motorway police group ( cmpg ) spotted the delorean - a replica of the car used in the back to the future films - being carried on the back of a tranpsporter between stoke-on-trent and crewe yesterday morning . officers who pulled over the famous car tweeted : ' look what i 've just stopped on the a500 . there is no escaping us no matter where you are in space time ! @ uktimemachine . ' police officers photographed the famous car as it travelled between stoke-on-trent and crewe yesterday . officers joked that the futuristic-looking car from the 1980s had a ' leaky flux capacitor ' from the movie . the car 's interior even had a multi-coloured hat similar to the one used by marty mcfly in the hit movie . they further joked that they had pulled the car over because it had a ' leaking flux capacitor ! and he had set the tarmac on fire ! @ highwaysengland wo n't be happy ! ' the futuristic looking delorean , which was built in belfast , is hired out for promotional events , weddings and birthdays . the looks almost the same as the movie prop . joining the fun , the owner of the vehicle , who calls themselves ' doc brown ' replied ' @ cmpg i was just asking for directions to hill valley 1985 ' . luckily for the the driver , the truck carrying the classic car was not travelling at 88mph and was allowed to continue on its journey . the back to the future trilogy featuring michael j fox was a massive hit between 1985 and 1990 making almost Â£750 million .
