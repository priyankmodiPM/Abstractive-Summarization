tim sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better . when aston villa 's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of christian benteke 's first half equaliser , he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the barclays premier league after all . indeed when he then saw benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes , he may have felt his damning critique on monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for . but the grit , desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a qpr side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses sherwood had highlighted . matt phillips ( left ) headed queens park rangers into a seventh-minute lead , getting on the end of bobby zamora 's cross . winger phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond brad guzan in the aston villa goal . joey barton wheels away after watching phillips nod in at the back post , as ciaran clark ( left ) and carlos sanchez appeal for offside . but qpr were only ahead for three minutes after christian benteke equalised for the hosts at villa park . benteke drove beyond rob green from the edge of the box to net his seventh premier league goal of the season . if it made for a hugely entertaining encounter , it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be . sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets , comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger . but when charlie austin followed chint hill 's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors , villa had replaced chris ramsey 's spirited side in the bottom three . only 12 minutes remained , and even if benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief . benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle . on the contrary , he looked devastated . both sides have some difficult games ahead but when tottenham and manchester city come next for villa , there is plenty to concern sherwood . a replay of qpr 's goals will not make pleasant viewing . the failure to close down bobby zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled matt phillips to strike after only seven minutes . the failure to challenge hill and so stop him scoring his first premier league goal . the failure too to respond to the threat being posed by austin , who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from phillips before driving the ball past brad guzan . such frailties could yet drag villa down this season , and sherwood knows it . ' we are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result , ' he complained afterwards , and on this evidence he would appear to be right .  aston villa ( 4-4-2 ) : guzan 6 ; bacuna 6 , vlaar 5.5 , clark 6 , richardson 6 ;

punishment for what appeared to be bacuna 's failure to stay with his man . austin 's goal â€“ his 17th in the premier league this season - would be a further source of concern , even if benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat green via the inside of a post . are they man enough ? only time will tell .
