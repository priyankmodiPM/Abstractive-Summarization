' i always see them as killing people because they do not believe in what you believe , or they are not being who you want them to be . ' i hate that , and do n't respond to those characters . they have been poison , this cultural genocide , because the audience is so overexposed to plot and explosions and shit that does n't mean nothing about the experience of being human . he added : 'superheroesâ€¦just the word hero bothers me . what the f*** does that mean ? ' it 's a false , misleading conception , the superhero . then , the way they apply violence to it , it 's absolutely right wing .

' she 's a slut ! ' renner told the digital spy interviewer , triggering huge guffaws from evans , who added : ' i was going to say something along that line ... a complete whore .

' before walking out of the interview . seemingly amused with the reaction , guru-murthy can be seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove robert 's clip-on microphone . at that point he turns and says : ' it 's all getting a bit diane sawyer [ a u.s. journalist known for her investigative interviewing ] .
