often take longer to recover fully , the government’s plan to increase funding of and participation in rugby in schools in the absence of a comprehensive system for injury surveillance and prevention is worrying . ’ she added . ‘ only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short and long term effects of injury prevention programmes , whether for rugby or any other sport , be known . ‘ many countries , including the uk , have inadequate child injury surveillance systems . under the united nations convention on the rights of the child governments have a duty to protect children from risks of injury . professor allyson pollock wants to see rugby made safer for children , with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur . ‘ the uk government should ensure the safety and effectiveness of sports and that injury surveillance and prevention strategies are established before proceeding

described how his ‘ face looked distorted’ and his ‘ eye socket was hanging down’ . she said : ‘i’m not calling for a ban on rugby at school . i’m calling for parents to be given information so they know the risks , and i want to see rugby made safer for children , with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur . ‘i’d like school rugby to become touch rugby , instead of contact rugby . all injuries should be recorded , and none should be acceptable or seen as ‘ an act of god’ . ‘ most of all , children should be safe at school . ’ the rugby football union – the professional body – has clear rules for school children and they are not allowed to tackle or form scrums until the age of ten . even then , tackles are minimal and the referee will blow the whistle as soon as the player is brought to the ground . and a maximum of between three and five players from each team can take part in scrums – where they interlock over the ball – depending on their age . currently , rugby is mainly played at independent schools rather than state schools where the dominant sport for boys is football . children under 10 play touch rugby where they have to pass the ball to the other side as soon as an opponent makes contact with any part of their body . a spokesman for the rfu said : ‘ we take player safety extremely seriously and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches , referees and medics , at all levels of the game.‘we believe that rugby is a fantastic sport for children , and the physical and social benefits massively outweigh any potential drawbacks . ‘ among the many benefits rugby brings for children is an increase in confidence , self-esteem and self-discipline , as well as getting enjoyable physical exercise while working as part of a team , learning skills which help them in the wider world . ‘ teachers frequently comment on notable off pitch improvements when the sport is introduced in their schools . ’
