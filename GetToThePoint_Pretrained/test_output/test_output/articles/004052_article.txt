' drain told whnt about the sweet promposal . like most prom nights , the festivities kicked off at joy 's house where she pinned a boutonniere on her poppa and he wrapped a corsage around her wrist . they then took pictures in front of the house in their evening wear , marking another first for drain who has never worn a tuxedo . getting ready : on saturday night , drain came over to his granddaughter 's house and the two swapped a boutonniere and corsage for the event . prom pictures : then , like typical prom dates , the two posted for pictures outside joy 's house in their evening wear . family photo : after having a pre-prom dinner , joy and her grandfather went on a horse and carriage ride around town . drain then escorted his granddaughter to mater 's restaurant for prom dinner , where he had a special surprise waiting for the granddaughter he calls ' princess ' . after finishing their meal , the two took a horse and carriage ride around the town before dropping them off at the school for the dance .
