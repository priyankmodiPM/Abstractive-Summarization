a freak snowstorm was captured on video engulfing a bridge and then a river in a matter of seconds in russia . the incredible weather event took place in siberia’s third largest city , krasnoyarsk , and shows the moment snow and sleet plunge the yenisei river into darkness . a video maker captured the storm , which initially it looks like a large white cloud , from the bank of a river . the snowstorm moved at a speed of 45mph and engulfed the��kommunalnyi bridge in a matter of seconds . suddenly the storm grows in size and begins moving at a speed of 45mph towards the kommunalnyi bridge , which it instantly dwarfs with its size . flecks of snow can be seen in the air as the large cloud becomes increasingly grey in colour and the bridge disappears from view . the video maker then tilts the camera slightly and captures the cloud moving overhead . flecks of snow become bigger and more frequent as the snowstorm continues to engulf the video maker . visibility is drastically reduced as the snowstorm engulfs the russian city in a matter of seconds . the flecks of snow suddenly become larger and more of them can be seen beating down on the side of the river bank . moving ever closer , the wind begins picking up and suddenly the visibility is next to zero . the video maker then captures a friend standing nearby before returning to film the storm , which the pair are now very much a part of . the video maker momentarily films a friend before returning to the storm , which they are now a part of . the video concludes with more snow pelting the video maker and the grey clouds obscuring the sun completely . according to reports , warm weather is thought to have caused the cyclone , which swept through the city centre in less than a minute .
