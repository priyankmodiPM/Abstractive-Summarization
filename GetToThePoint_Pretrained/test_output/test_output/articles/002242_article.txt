when you’re in good touch , it just takes a moment . nathan redmond had only been on the pitch for six minutes when he made the decisive intervention in this tightly-fought encounter , but what a crucial one it could prove to be . steven whittaker , with sharp eyes and precise feet , played redmond in down the right touchline , the ball hugging the white line as it went forward . redmond’s natural acceleration saw him spectacularly outpace joe bennett and his low cross was fired high into the net by bradley johnson at the back post . bradley johnson celebrates after firing home a second-half winner at the amex stadium . the norwich goalscorer showed his delight after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal . norwich striker cameron jerome is brought down by brighton captain gordon greer during the clash . brighton ( 4-3-3 ) : stockdale ;
