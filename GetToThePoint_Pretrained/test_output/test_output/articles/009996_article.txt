the view that manchester city’s chance at defending their premier league title has been ruined through bad spending gathered pace after they were defeated by a club whose entire team cost less than half one of their substitutes . crystal palace’s xi on monday night may only have been worth a mere £17m , but left back martin kelly still made it through a city defence deemed good enough to keep £40m signing eliaquim mangala on the bench to tee up a chance for wilfried zaha just 60 seconds into the game . mangala joined from porto in august last year and is contracted to city until june 2019 . eliaquim mangala ( green bib ) prepares to come on but he never made it off the manchester city bench . however , striker glenn murray succeeded in putting another dent in city’s chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away , when he scored palace’s first goal . murray cost palace nothing when joined from arch rivals brighton in 2011 . jason puncheon , signed for a comparative pittance of £1.9m , delivered city their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick . glenn murray ( left ) cost palace nothing four years ago yet found a way past the city defence . another expensive city player , £24m-man yaya toure , got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left , but they couldn’t penetrate palace’s defence to find an equaliser and a 2-1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top . toure joined from barcelona in july 2010 and is contracted to city until 2017 . after spending a total of £500m pounds on transfer fees , city might have expected to be higher than a precarious fourth in the league , but judging by their latest results , it’s teams like crystal palace that seem to be getting their value for money . mangala has endured a miserable first season at the etihad stadium since his £40million move .
