' investigators found footprints on the hood of the malibu ( left ) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car ( right ) that brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . investigators eventually concluded that neither russell nor williams had a gun . an exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit , including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water , but no gun was ever found . regardless of the trial 's outcome , the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come . the incident helped spur a us justice department probe that concluded cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force . the city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce . cleveland has already paid $ 3million to the families of russell and williams to settle a lawsuit .
