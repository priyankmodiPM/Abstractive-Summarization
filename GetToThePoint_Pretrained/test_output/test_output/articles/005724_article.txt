george osborne has refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the conservatives win a second term . the chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be ‘ depriving more families’ of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year . more than a million households lost out when the coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit . earners over £60,000 lost out altogether . scroll down for video . chancellor george osborne , pictured visiting the red cone cafe in stourbridge , refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the conservatives win a second term . the controversial measure , brought in two and a half years ago as part of the government’s austerity programme , was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers . it meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child , and £13.70 for every subsequent child . mr osborne was asked at a briefing in central london on the economy this morning whether he could ‘ rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you’ve already done in this parliament ? ’ the conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term . of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill , with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance . while the prime minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension , few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family’s annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000 . mr osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold , only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system universal credit , which is being rolled out nationally . the respected think tank the institute for fiscal studies have suggested that increasing universal credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year . the chancellor said : ‘ you can judge us on our record in this parliament . if we wanted to put child benefit into universal credit we would have done it when we set up universal credit . ‘we’ve got a track record , we’ve got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay , sharpening work incentives . ’ asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts , he said : ‘i’ve given you a very clear answer . we’ve created a welfare system where child poverty is down , inequality is down , we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable . ‘ we are going to carry on doing that in the next parliament . but we can’t do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy . ’ mr osborne was asked at a briefing in central london on the economy this morning whether he could ‘ rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you’ve already done in this parliament ? ' the chancellor said the coalition had saved £21billion in this parliament , and the ‘ same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare . the chancellor said the coalition had saved £21billion in this parliament , and the ‘ same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare . ‘ this is perfectly achievable and anyone who thinks that the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed , i think , is mistaken . ‘ we want to go on creating a welfare system which rewards work and the aspirations of families and protect the most vulnerable’ , he said . it is widely speculated that the conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children , to save around £2billion a year . work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith is sympathetic to the idea . he recently said it was ‘ well worth looking at’ and could save ‘ significant money’ and help with ‘ behaviour change’ by forcing couples to think carefully about whether they could afford to have another child . it was not seriously considered in this parliament due to opposition from the liberal democrats and david cameron appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low-income families . the event attended by mr osborne , and treasury minister david gauke and priti patel was an analysis of the labour’s party fiscal plans , if ed miliband gets into downing street . he claimed the labour party would ‘never’ eliminate the budget deficit – unlike tory plans to run a surplus by 2020 – because they would borrow billions of pounds every year and not cut spending . ‘ when the economy 's growing , and we 're not in recession , we should be raising more than we spend’ , he said . ‘ that 's the way , proven around the world , to bear down on your national debt and best prepare yourself for any future economic storms . fixing the roof while the sun is shining . ‘ the labour party do n't want to do that , they only talked about balancing the current , day to day , spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending . what they do n't tell you is that means a permanent , never-ending budget deficit . ’ labour’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie said mr osborne had put middle income families in the firing line . he said : ‘ the tories wo n't admit where their £12 billion of welfare cuts will come from , but after this press conference it 's now clear middle income families are in the firing line . ‘ george osborne repeatedly refused to rule out rolling child benefit into universal credit . this would mean 4.3 million families losing over £1,000 a year , according to the independent institute for fiscal studies . ’ an aide to mr osborne played down suggestions the conservatives were planning changes to child benefit . �4a ,
