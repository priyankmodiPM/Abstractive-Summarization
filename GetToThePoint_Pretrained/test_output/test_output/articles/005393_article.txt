a carpenter from south california has created what may well be the world’s biggest see-saw . kyle toth , who runs his own custom woodworking business , built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in temecula . it measures a whopping 45ft in length , and according to its maker , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft . kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born . as seen in the video , the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials – a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree . kyle told mailonline : ‘ i was cutting down some dead and damaged trees one day and was trying to drop this tree in between two others . ‘ it did n't go as planned and ended up dropping in between a tree that had two huge branches splitting . ‘ it fell basically where it is now but was about 65ft long and was laying on my fence . ‘ so i cut the tree at what looked like would be even on both sides and just like that a massive teeter totter ( american term for seesaw ) was born . kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk into the split branches to stop it from sliding . there is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on . ‘ the whole thing kind of just happened . it ended up being the perfect weight on both sides . ‘ i climbed up the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the tree trunk down into the split branches to stop it from sliding . ‘ i then called up a few of my friends and they came over really quickly once they heard . ’ while there is no seat attached to the trunk , handrails have been added for support and ropes can be seen dangling from the base of it . kyle said : ‘ we had to attach a rope on one side so that when one person gets on they can pull the other person up and let someone else on . the seesaw measures 45ft in length , and according to kyle , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft . ‘ i got on with one of my friends and it worked perfectly . it was a bit scary at first because it 'll send you about 25ft in the air . ‘ we used it for about 20 minutes . it’s so much fun . it takes the childhood ask of playing on a teeter totter and magnifies it by a thousand . ‘ basically if you were six-years-old and had never seen a regular teeter totter before that 's what it would be like to see this thing as an adult . ’ according to kyle , four people can ride on the seesaw at one time and there is an amazing view from the top . the short clip , captured from two angles , shows two people riding the seesaw – one pumps the air in celebration and swings his dangling legs . kyle said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand . kyle 's woodwork has been featured in the providence art show , boston’s world trade center furniture show and the del mar woodworking competition in california . a number of people have commented positively on the video with one youtube user writing : ‘ that and a beer looks like a good time . ’ the carpenter , who launched his business , wood by kyle toth , in 2010 claims to have developed a passion for woodwork from a young age . his work has been featured in the providence art show , boston’s world trade center furniture show and the del mar woodworking competition in california .
