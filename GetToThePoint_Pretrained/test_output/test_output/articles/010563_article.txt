' it 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ' easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ' no one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' he said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' i want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . he said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ' after tucking straight into the crème egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ' the cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ' ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . my nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist !
