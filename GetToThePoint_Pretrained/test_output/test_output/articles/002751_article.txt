' i do n't regret nagging her or telling her that i wanted her to be around because i loved her and was not ready to be without her , ' she writes .

' i do n't think i ever would have felt like that 's the government 's call . ' phillips says she is aware that some groups fear that this law could cause abuse for people with disabilities but said there are measures in the law to prevent that from happening . ' i do empathize with that concern , ' phillips told kpcc . ' in my experience , ' she says , ' i 've only seen it play out in such a way that people are not given the choice to end their suffering ... there is a way to navigate potential abuses , without robbing people of the choice about their own lives . ' amber told dailymail.com that the choice to live or die is a heartbreaking one , but one that belongs to every terminally ill individual . milestones : amber , her mother connie , and her brothers all witnessed many milestones and amber said had her mother had control over her own death she could have been surrounded by loved ones and family .
