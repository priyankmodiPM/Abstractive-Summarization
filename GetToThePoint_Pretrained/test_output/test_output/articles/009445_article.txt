while we all know the key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding a middle ground between the amount of food you eat and the amount of exercise you put in , it can sometimes be a bit tricky to anticipate exactly how much exercise is required . with easter just around the corner we thought it would be helpful to give you a real life gauge on how much cardio you 'll need to put in to get the most out of your easter binge session . starting at the very bottom of the chocolate egg scale is the mini solid egg , around four of them equate to 550 kilojules . after eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you 'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away . a 67-kilogram woman who ate only four of these snack sized treats would need to vigorously walk for around 40 minutes before the guilt , and the calories melted away . a man weighing in at around 80 kilograms could achieve the same in 30 minutes . any child , or grown adult for that matter , out on an easter scavenger hunt is sure to come across a chocolate replica of the easter bunny himself . you would need to run for about half an hour to burn off a hollow chocolate egg . what you’ll be surprised to find is that a medium chocolate bunny contains around 4400 kilojules that won’t burn themselves off . if you chose the humble kayak as your weapon against weight gain , ladies you 'd be expected to paddle for at least three hours to burn that bunny off . gents you 've lucked out in this department and will only have to spend around two hours in the water . if cycling is more your style , then men you 'll need to spend just under two hours pedaling and ladies , you 'll need to put in just over that for that bunny to be history . if you wanted to munch on a small bunny there’s no avoiding the 2212 kilojules that come with it . ladies , you could hop in the pool and swim for just over an hour , or guys just under an hour , before that bunny would have melted away . if you 've taken home a large chocolate bunny you can expect to spend at least three hours playing squash before you have worked off the 11060 kilojules added to your daily intake . for those who like their easter with all the trimmings can expect to spend around three and a half hours on the squash court for women and just under three hours for men , before they’ll be able to burn off a large bunny which adds around 11060 kilojules to your daily calorie intake . chocolate isn’t the only temptation around easter time with two hot cross buns containing around 1800 kilojules , and that 's without any butter or jam ! fruit hot cross buns will have you hitting the pavement for an hour- and that 's if you forgo the generous layer of butter ! for those who can go without the extra spread you’ll need to run for about 40-50 minutes to work them off . for those who can’t , expect another 30 minutes of cardio before the calories are gone ! if you thought classic hot cross buns were bad , wait until you’re faced with 1030 kilojules of choc-chip hot cross bun- and that’s just for one ! men will need to salute the sun for around an hour and fifteen minutes with ladies putting in an hour and a half of yoga before the singular bun will vanish ! hot cross bun 's calorie laden , choc chip counterpart will require around an hour and a half of yoga before it 's completely gone !
