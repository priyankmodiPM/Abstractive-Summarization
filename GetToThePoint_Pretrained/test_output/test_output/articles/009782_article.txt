while sunseekers across britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine , the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars . this incredible image was captured above pitcaple in aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer graeme whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the lyrid meteor shower . the annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe , but is most visible in the northern hemisphere , and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour . scroll down for video . close up : a magnified version of the image above shows one meteor appearing to graze the horizon , while another meteor trail appears top left . stunning : graeme whipps captured this image of the lyrid meteor shower in the skies above pitcaple in aberdeenshire yesterday . the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour , but in 1982 americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour . the lyrids are created by debris from comet thatcher , which takes about 415 years to orbit around the sun , and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as vega and the constellation lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name . mr whipps , a 50-year-old meteorologist , said : ' i was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor , which was amazing . ' while the lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour , most years the peak , which occurs tonight , only produces between five and 20 per hour ( the lyrid shower pictured from space ) .
