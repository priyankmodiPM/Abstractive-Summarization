' everyone i 've spoken to - people in business , the job centre , my friends and family just do n't know why i do n't even get interviews . ' the sheer fact i have moved three times to work should imply i am eager to work . ' it 's hard to blame anyone without being able to put my finger on the issue in the first place . ' searching : mr davies has a geography degree and three a-levels , but has not even been called for interview . mr davies initially wanted to find a job related to his degree , specifically employment within the environmental or town planning sectors . but after his numerous setbacks , the 34-year-old is now willing to settle for almost anything . he has put his name forward for roles including office jobs , administration , factory work - and even a position as a train driver . mr davies , who spends his spare time writing and has published three poetry books and is currently working on two novels , has also registered with job agencies in cardiff and swansea . he says he is not fussed about where he is based .

' my cv has been redone by three or four different people . ' all my friends can not believe it . they say i must be the most unfortunate person . ' i ca n't think of anyone else who would leave britain three times to find work . i even applied for a job as a train driver , just because it was there . ' i feel awful thinking i have a lot to offer but no one wants to use me . it 's frustrating , upsetting . if i was very blas√© it would be a whole different story . ' he added : ' my job centre told me ages ago i was caught in a catch-22 , saying i was over-qualified for a factory-type job but under-experienced for the kind of job i wanted to do . ' struggle : the 34-year-old will work anywhere in britain , but despite his flexibility , he has not secured a job . mr davies is not the first luckless candidate to struggle finding a job . in 2011 , leanne shipley , 18 , from east yorkshire , applied for 300 jobs without hearing back from a single one . in the same year , 19-year-old bob jewers , from county durham , said he had been rejected from 400 jobs , only getting replies from four . a spokesman for the department for work and pensions said employment in wales went up in the last quarter by 24,000 people . the spokesman added : ' unemployment fell in the last three months by 13,000 so there are just 92,000 people out of work in wales .
