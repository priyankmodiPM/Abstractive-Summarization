' we 're listening to her side ' of the story , he said . last year , a number of garcia’s friends and neighbors painted a very different picture , saying the woman was so happy with her husband that she was desperate to add to their family and have another baby . she had apparently had fertility injections prior to the birth of their daughter three years ago . and she told neighbors adely rios and her father , ernesto , that she was undergoing more treatment to have a second child . lat year , police described the ordeal during which the now 25-year-old woman — broken through mental , physical and sexual abuse — was moved at least four times and given multiple fake identities to hide her from family and authorities . arraignment : isidro garcia , 41 , pictured last year during an arraignment hearing in santa ana . the woman , who police did not identify by name , said she often thought about escaping but stayed out of fear , even though in recent years she was not physically held captive . then , in april of last year , the woman got in touch with her mother after finding her sister on facebook to wish her a happy birthday , santa ana police cpl . anthony bertagna said . the mother showed the daughter news articles written at the time of her 2004 disappearance to prove that she had gone to the police and filed a missing-persons report , according to bertagna . the woman said in a television interview that she was overjoyed to be reunited with her family . ' i was very afraid about everything because i was alone , ' she told kabc-tv . police said that the woman had arrived in the u.s. from mexico several months before her abduction and did not speak english at the time . after one fight between the girl 's mother and garcia in august 2004 , the girl 's mother left the house and the girl went to a nearby park . confused neighbors : neighbor maria sanchez holds a photo of her neighbor isidro garcia at his daughter 's third birthday . garcia allegedly followed the girl . when he caught up with her , she said she had a headache and wanted to go home . he told her then , ' you ca n't go home . you 're here illegally . you do n't speak the language . your mom 's called the police . they will send you back . i 'm your only hope , ' bertagna said . garcia allegedly gave her five pills that he said would help her headache but instead knocked her out . when the girl awoke , she was locked in a garage in compton , a city between santa ana and los angeles . the mother ' filed a police report and for 10 years ( police ) did due diligence . but they were changing their names and dates of birth and physical locations so that made it exceedingly difficult , ' bertagna said . in 2007 , garcia got documents from mexico that gave the girl a new name and date of birth . using those documents , he married her at a courthouse . police said the woman tried to escape twice but was severely beaten .
