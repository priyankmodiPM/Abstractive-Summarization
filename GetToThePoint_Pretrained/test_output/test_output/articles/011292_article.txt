whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a los angeles beach early sunday should not confuse the animal 's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite , according to an animal rescue expert . witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from dockweiler state beach , just west of the city 's international airport , said los angeles police officer rosario herrera . the initial police report said the animal was a small seal . marine animal rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it . witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup ( not pictured ) in a blanket and left in a car around from dockweiler state beach . but a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion , according to peter wallerstein , the president of the group marine animal rescue . the rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old , said wallerstein , who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help . sea lions of this size are ' really small , really look cute , but they 're dangerous , ' he said . ' these are wild animals . ' they 're also not fit to be kept as pets . though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous , officials warned . ' the animal needs fluids , needs special treatments , ' he said . ' you ca n't just feed it dog food . it 's not going to work . ' los angeles police said an investigation was being conducted by the federal national oceanic and atmospheric administration . a spokesman for the agency did not return phone messages or an email sunday .
