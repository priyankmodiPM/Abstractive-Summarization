' to partake in the joys of the first treats of spring can turn ugly without notice and , sadly , a visit to maine’s most populous city yesterday was the day when the ugly became personal and my nine-year-old daughter learned that there are people who will never know her essence but instead will reduce her to nothing more than a n***** .

' stewart-bouley wrote : ' i was upset but that was not the time and place to be emotional ' . she added in her blog post that while she was grateful for ward 's observations she was saddened that she was not comfortable enough following the exchange to come over to the family and ask if they were okay .

' she added : ' i understand now that my inaction was hurtful to the family and for that i 'm very sorry . it was not due to a lack of outrage or sympathy but simply that i did n't know whether the family would appreciate someone interjecting themselves into the situation . ' i thought that the way i could help would be by bringing awareness to it by writing about it . ' as for stewart-bouley and her family , she said on friday during the car ride home the mood of the day had been destroyed . she said her family was reminded that the world can be an utterly ugly place . as her daughter asked if they could move away , she told her ' ugly can live anywhere ' . ' if i felt there was a place that was safe and where we could be assured that we would never hear that word again , i would move heaven and earth to get us there , ' she wrote .
