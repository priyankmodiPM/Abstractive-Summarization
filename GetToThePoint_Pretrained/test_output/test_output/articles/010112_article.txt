' acoustic scientists from curtin university refuse to rule out the possibility that ' distinctive ' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the indian ocean . a detailed map of the search was released by the australian government . dr alec duncan and his associates from the university 's centre for marine science and technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of rottnest island just after 1:30 am utc on march 8 . ' data from one of the imos ( integrated marine observing system ) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of mh370 , ' dr duncan said in a statement released by curtin university . ' the crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds . ' curtin university centre for marine science and technology 's dr alec duncan began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . malaysia 's civil aviation chief , azharuddin abdul rahman declared the crash an accident . dr duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event , including a small earth tremor , but the timing piqued the interest of his research team . the crash was officially declared an accident by malaysia civil aviation chief azharuddin abdul rahman earlier this year .
