yips in recent times . the world will find out which version of woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm . defending champion bubba watson , hoping to win his third masters title in four years , will tee off at 2.24pm alongside england 's former us open champion justin rose and 21-year-old south korean amateur gunn yang , who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the us amateur last year . those watching the 2.02pm group on thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game 's most colourful characters go head-to-head . ian poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet , but even he might meet his match in american young gun patrick reed , who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at doral last year . he followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at gleneagles . three-time masters champion phil

on the course for round one and two . woods will be accompanied with wales' jamie donaldson and jimmy walker of the usa during the first two rounds of the competition . us open champion martin kaymer is in the group behind world no 1 mcilroy , with brandt snedeker and houston open winner jb holmes . mcilroy and mickelson were among the players battling for the us pga title in near-darkness at valhalla last year , with mickelson and rickie fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of mcilroy and bernd wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light . with 98 players in the field , charley hoffman and brian harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm ( 7:45am local time ) , with gary player and jack nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier , the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while arnold palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder . england 's danny willett will begin his masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner larry mize and us amateur public links champion byron meth . woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round . the american superstar has started just two events in 2015 , carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second , but said he was ready to ' compete to win a golf tournament ' after 11 holes of practice on monday . the final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world , australia 's jason day , spain 's sergio garcia and fowler . fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year .
