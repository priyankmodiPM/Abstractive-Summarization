' belinda 's problems began when she noticed she was looking more tired than usual and set about finding a cosmetic solution . in the uk , the average facelift costs Â£7,900 , so belinda was thrilled when she found a turkish surgeon offering cut-price operations that cost a fraction of the uk equivalent . having already had successful cosmetic procedures in the past , among them breast implants and a tummy tuck , she says she felt positive about the prospect of facelift . her husband agreed at the time , hoping it might ' freshen her up ' , but says , with hindsight , that ' it was one of the worst ideas i 've ever had in my life .
