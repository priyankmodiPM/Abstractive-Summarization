' total strangers talked , and worked , shoulder to shoulder , and figured it out , ' he wrote in an exclusive for fox 13 salt lake city . ' they did n't know each otherâ€™s names , and they did n't care . they ruined their clothes , they interrupted their plans , and they made a memory to last a lifetime . and yes , they saved shelby .
