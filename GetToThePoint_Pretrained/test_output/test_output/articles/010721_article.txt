former sunderland defender danny higginbotham has described a controversial speech made by roy keane which he calls ' one of the most bizarre team talks i 've ever experienced ' . higginbotham and his black cats team-mates were about to take on aston villa during the 2007-08 premier league season when keane sat them down in the home changing room at the stadium of light . but instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them , the former manchester united midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk . republic of ireland assistant manager roy keane ( left ) looks frustrated during his country 's draw with poland . keane watches his sunderland players in action against aston villa after delivering his ' bizarre ' team talk . danny higginbotham ( right ) gave struggling sunderland the lead during the game on december 15 , 2007 . in his new autobiography rise of the underdog : my life inside football , higginbotham - who scored in sunderland 's 1-1 draw with villa that day - describes keane 's attempt to motivate his players . ' '' listen lads , ' he said . ' basically you 're s*** . try and enjoy the game . you 're probably going to get beat . but just enjoy being s*** . '' ' then he just walked out . those words have got to be insulting to any professional , no matter who they come from , and i 'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong . i scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time . we ended up drawing . ' higginbotham also reveals how keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them . aston villa winger shaun maloney ( right ) scored a free-kick to secure a 1-1 draw for the visitors . keane is now part of martin o'neill 's backroom staff after leaving his role at aston villa earlier this season . higginbotham ( right ) , pictured in action against manchester city , played under keane for a season . referring to a talk with keane , higginbotham writes : ' '' danny , all i 'm f****** hearing from you when i 'm watching that game yesterday is f****** encouragement . that 's all i 'm hearing . '' i thought , well , that 's not so bad . `` i do n't f****** want that . i want you to tell some of them they 're being c**** . tell them . '' ' despite a 2-0 loss away at bolton in the season 's penultimate game , sunderland secured their premier league safety with a match to spare . but although he had helped ensure another year in england 's top-flight , keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against gary megson 's side . higginbotham ( left ) now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in january , 2014 . reliving his manager 's post-match team talk , higginbotham writes : ' '' you 're the reason i 'm driving up and down the f****** country to find another player , you 're not f****** good enough , '' he yells at one player . ' '' your attitude is s*** . you 're not good enough , '' he bawls at others . ' '' next week we 've got our last home game , against arsenal . you know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch , thank the fans for their support ? i 'm ringing umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers , because you 're a f****** embarrassment , it 's a joke and this is not going to stay this way .
