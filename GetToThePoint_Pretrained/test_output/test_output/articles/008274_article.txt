' it depends on how well it goes . i 'm preparing myself mentally that i wo n't play again this season , so if i come back earlier then it 's a bonus . ' i was in the gym doing some exercises like i normally do , but just went a bit too far with one of them and unfortunately i dislocated my shoulder . ' i 'd have been frustrated if i had done it on the pitch , so to do it in the gym made it even more frustrating . tomkins celebrates with west ham united midfielder kevin nolan at upton park . ' i had the operation about two weeks ago and it has settled down . i 'm progressing with my rehab and getting more movement and hopefully i can get back as soon as i can . ' when you look at the fixtures , we have got quite winnable games , so i am confident the lads can get a lot of points from them with the squad we have got . ' i hope the lads stay injury-free and can push on and secure at least a top-half finish - that 's definitely our aim . '
