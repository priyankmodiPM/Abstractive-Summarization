' i was most surprised about how people feel about death , ' luk said . ' i took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly . there were 7 corpses on that day ... one of them was a child . ' during the ceremony a monk will pray then the `` sky burial master '' will start cutting the corpses . when he is done , the condors will all fly to the corpses . ' they believe the more the condors eat , the better it is and they will not eat bad people 's body . ' nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . snow covers the surrounding hills of the larung gar buddhist academy , where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . the resplendent buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy , with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . at the peak close to the town , monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . one encounter which struck a chord for luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her ' no speech day ' . when the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist . she ended up taking him around the whole monastery , showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray . although tvs are prohibited in the monastery , iphones strangely are permitted , with her typing words to instruct him as they went . at night the view of the serthar buddhist institute is magical , with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . the settlement is also home to a number of tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . prayer stones decorate the colourful buddhist academy , which is only accessible by a long coach journey . tibetan nuns , also known as lamas , are pictured on a street in the serthar buddhist institute . the sprawling settlement , sertar , sits on elevations of 12,500ft , and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . many of the buddhists own second-hand iphone 4s . the incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by jigme phuntsok , an influential lama of the nyingma tradition . despite its remote situation , larung gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest buddhist settlement in the world . it attracts a mix of students from ethnic chinese students to pupils from taiwan , hong kong , singapore , and malaysia , who attend separate classes taught in mandarin , while larger classes are taught in tibetan .
