' but before vaughan could finish his sentence cook was tempted to follow a jerome taylor delivery outside off stump and squirted a waist-high catch to gully for 13 . despite being the favourite for the director of cricket job , vaughan is seeking more clarity over the role . speaking earlier this week , he said : ' i think the role needs to be defined , what exactly it is and what the team require . i do n't think anyone can say whether they are interested or not until then . ' all i 've said is i 'd like to know what that role is , as andrew strauss has said , and alec stewart . all of us would be ¬interested if the role was right . so it 's just a case of waiting to see . ' but despite an ashes summer on the horizon , vaughan added : ' i do n't think the ecb have to panic . they have to take their time . ' we have a big summer coming up , but this is about the future of england cricket . '
