and possibly crimes against humanity , the report adds . human rights watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from isis , which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault , sexual slavery and forced marriage – acts that constitute war crimes . now they are urging that survivors get the medical and psychological treatment that they need to cope with the unimaginable trauma they suffered . a 31-year-old yazidi woman named rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the isis fighters who had captured her . ‘ later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names ' , the 31-year-old said . ‘ the man who selected me , abu ghufran , forced me to bathe but while i was in the bathroom i tried to kill myself . ‘ i had found some poison in the house , and took it with me to the bathroom . i knew it was toxic because of its smell . ‘ i distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it . none of us died but we all got sick . ’ rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war . these women were part of a group of 216 yazidis who were recently released by isis after being captured last year . another woman , identified as dilara , said she was taken to a wedding hall in syria where isis fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children . from 9:30am in the morning , men would come to buy girls to rape them . the survivors ' stories come as united nations ( un ) investigators found evidence isis are committing genocide against the yazidi minority in iraq . the human rights office published a horrifying report in march describing killings , torture , rape , sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists . it suggested they may be guilty of ' war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide ' . the report , based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between june 2014 and february 2015 , highlights brutal isis attacks on the yazidis . the jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed , according to investigators . younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the ' spoils of war ' . head of the investigation suki nagra said : ' these attacks were aimed at destroying the yazidi as a group . ' she added that isis was guilty of ' genocide ' against the minority . she told human rights watch : ' i saw in front of my eyes isis soldiers pulling hair , beating girls , and slamming the heads of anyone who resisted . ' they were like animals… . once they took the girls out , they would rape them and bring them back to exchange for new girls . the girls’ ages ranged from eight to 30 years… only 20 girls remained in the end . ' this comes just weeks after the release of 216 yazidi prisoners who had been held captive since last summer when isis militants attacked their villages in the area around sinjar in northwestern iraq . the freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution , but instead , were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions . it was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the yazidis , whom they consider devil-worshippers , but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances . yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of islamic state , which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery . the united nations said last month that the islamic state may have committed genocide against the minority . the yazidis are an ancient , predominantly kurdish , people who follow their own religion derived from islam , christianity and zoroastrianism .
