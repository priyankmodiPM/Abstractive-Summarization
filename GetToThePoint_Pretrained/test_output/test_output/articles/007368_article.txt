' then , seeing this tweet , dad deion sanders decided to have a little fun with his son , and give him a piece of his mind , writing back ; ' you 're a huxtable with a million $ trust fund stop the hood stuff ! lololol . son . # truth '' . a huxtable is a phrase used by some to refer to upper class black people . scroll down for video . deion sanders ( left ) called out his son deion sanders jr.
