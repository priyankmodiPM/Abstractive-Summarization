' jack rodwell and scott sinclair , for example , both spent time at city but did not play a great deal . ' they 're featuring more regularly now , for sunderland and on loan at aston villa respectively , but the decision for a player like sinclair is would he be willing to join another club on a permanent deal if it meant less money ? ' the left back scored a stunning free-kick last weekend against stoke , as he showed his attacking prowess , as well as his defensive solidity . it remains to be seen if cresswell will be at the club next season but with an england call-up being touted , west ham may face a tough task of keeping their prized asset . allardyce will be praying he can keep his prized asset from the clutches of the big clubs such as city . cresswell scored a stunning free-kick against stoke at upton park on saturday to put them in front . jack rodwell ( right ) moved to city from everton but struggled before leaving the club for sunderland .
