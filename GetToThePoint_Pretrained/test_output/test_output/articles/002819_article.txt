fernando torres has played with some great players over the years but the on-loan atletico madrid striker regards steven gerrard as the best . torres spent three-and-half-seasons at the english club and struck up a close friendship with the former england captain , even returning to anfield to play in his charity match against jamie carragher 's side . since leaving the club in 2011 , torres has never quite found his best form - suffering a miserable time with chelsea before signing for ac milan and returning to atletico on loan . he has scored four times since heading back to spain in january . fernando torres ( left ) and steven gerrard became good friends during his successful career at liverpool . he told marca plus magazine : ' out of all the great players i have played with , gerrard , for me , is the best . ' but he is more than that - he is a good friend who , as a captain , is always there for his players . ' i know what liverpool means to him , so yes i would have loved to see my friend finish his final season with a trophy , but it was not to be . ' he has had so much success for liverpool that i am sure the final game is going to be very emotional for him and the fans . ' torres ' new side travel to rivals real madrid for a place in the champions league semi-final on wednesday , knowing that they have n't lost to their neighbours in the previous six matches . the 31-year-old has struggled for form since leaving the club and has only scored four goals for atletico . gerrard was unable to end his liverpool career on a high by winning the fa cup after defeat by aston villa .
