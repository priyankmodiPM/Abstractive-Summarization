while it might be the nation 's largest grocer , walmart supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel in a recent survey of america 's supermarkets . the retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in consumer reports ' annual survey , and this year it was rated number 67 , the second worst supermarket . as it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine , walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce . however , it was noted for its better-than-average prices . walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in consumer reports ' annual supermarket survey . the retailer ( above a worker in the produce section of a walmart in miama ) came in at number 67 followed by chain waldbaum 's , which was in last place . ' every store i go in has room to improve , ' said walmart ceo doug mcmillon in a statement that the company released to consumer reports . ' i can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better . ' and if we nail those , one store at a time , our short-term performance gets better . ' the respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness , food quality , freshness and staff courtesy . walmart was joined by a & p ( rated number 66 ) and waldbaum 's ( number 68 ) , which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed , according to cbs . the annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts , which was cited by a quarter of respondents . other findings included : source : consumer reports . america 's favorite supermarket , taking first place , is new york-based wegmans . the retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness , baked goods and overall shopping experience . publix came in second place followed by trader joe 's , fareway stores and market basket . wegmans was also among a total of three grocers , including whole foods and the fresh market , that earned outstanding produce scores . ' it 's going to sound clich√© , but our employees are our secret sauce , ' jo natale , wegmans ' vice president of media relations told consumer report . natale also shed light on the fact that wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded , which ' allows us to take a long-range view , invest in people , and grow at a controlled rate . ' while only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely satisfied with the quality of their store 's produce , meat and poultry offerings ; nationwide , consumer reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings . findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including wegmans , publix , costco , whole foods and fresh market were considered standouts in this category . so as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $ 5,400 on food , what makes a supermarket the best ? the survey noted that those who were the ' freshest ' stores were usually the best overall . wegmans ( file photo above ) was rated america 's favorite supermarket followed by publix , trader joe 's and fareway stores . in the past , check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers , but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy , unprocessed fruits , vegetables , meat and fish . they also want more organics and local produce . ' there 's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods , especially among younger consumers , ' says willard bishop 's jim hertel . ' they 're suspicious about food additives and so sure ' less is more , ' that they buy gluten-free even if they 're not allergic to gluten .
