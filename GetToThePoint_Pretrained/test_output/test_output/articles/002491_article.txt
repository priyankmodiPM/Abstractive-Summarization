rafa nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect , confidence-boosting start with a 6-2 , 6-1 win over frenchman lucas pouille in the monte carlo masters . it was a businesslike display from the world no 5 . he didn’t unleash the full power of his forehand but played sensible , measured tennis and made only five unforced errors in the match . his talented 21-year-old opponent showed flashes of attacking flair , including one outrageous half-volley forehand winner , but was never able to put enough balls in court to trouble the great spaniard . rafael nadal safely made his way into third round of the monte carlo masters with win against lucas pouille . nadal got his clay court season off to the perfect start with a straight sets victory 6-2 , 6-1 . nadal broke in the sixth game of the match to go 4-2 up , and a shanked backhand from the world no 108 handed him another break and the first set . the nine-time french open winner began the second set in the same steady form and broke pouille twice to serve for the match at 5-1 . he arrowed a vintage forehand down the line to seal a place in the third round , where he will face either john isner or viktor troicki . the spaniard is an eight-time champion in monte carlo , but has not won here since 2012 and said last week that he is ‘ not the favourite for anything’ at the moment . frenchman pouille showed glimpses of his talent but was unable to trouble nadal . nadal is an eight-time champion at monte carlo but has n't won the tournament since 2012 . this victory was the first step in rebuilding his self-belief after disappointing losses in the quarter-finals of the indian wells masters and the third round in miami last month . it is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best , and he will face sterner tests later in the week , but he could not have asked for a better opening display .
