keeping david de gea at the club would be the biggest signing manchester united could make this summer , says phil neville . the spanish keeper has impressed for louis van gaal 's side this season and has heavily been linked with a move to real madrid , who are looking for a long-term replacement for iker casillas . united have been linked with their own big-money moves for the likes of gareth bale and mats hummels , but neville believes the club must concentrate on keeping de gea at old trafford . david de gea met man united fans earlier in the week as part of a day organised by the club 's foundation . de gea punches the ball away during manchester united 's 1-0 defeat to chelsea at stamford bridge . ' the biggest thing is david de gea , and keeping him at the football club , ' neville told the manchester evening news . ' from when he first came , to how he is now , i don’t think i’ve seen a player develop and improve as quickly as him . ' i saw with cristiano ( ronaldo ) , i saw the development in terms of his performance , his size , his stature and his physique . 'he’s winning football games on his own . last minutes saves against everton , hull , arsenal away - there’s seven or eight occasions where he has won united games which just shows you that he is world-class .
