' one former syrian rebel who became an isis regional commander told the washington post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group 's day-to-day business were ex members of hussein 's baathist army . as well as their extensive military expertise , another key element of the commanders ' appointments has been the fact the ex-baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to hussein 's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s . crucially , oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of isis ' £2 billion-a-year income . influence : despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , isis ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of saddam hussein ( pictured ) . past : the process of giving former iraqi commanders senior roles was started by abu bakr al-baghdadi 's predecessor abu omar al-baghdadi ( left ) who was a former iraqi army officer and therefore more trusted than the jordanian criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded isis , abu musab al-zarqawi ( right ) . the former iraqi army generals ' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to isis ' £2 billion-a-year income . middle east analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former iraqi army commanders have joined isis is due to the de-baathification law brought in l.­ paul bremer - the american who served as temporary head of the iraqi state following the ousting of hussein . the law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions . many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s , which was dominated by isis who at the time were known by the name al qaeda in iraq . when al-baghdadi took control of the group in 2010 , many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the sunni tribes who dominate western iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country 's shia-led baghdad government . the process had , however been started by al-baghdadi 's predecessor abu omar al-baghdadi who was himself a former iraqi army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the jordanian criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded isis , abu musab al-zarqawi . one of the most prominent former iraqi army generals within isis was fadel ahmad abdullah al-hiyali , who used the code name abu muslim al-turkmani , and was in charge of all the terrorists ' operations in iraq until he was killed in an american airstrike last november . he had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in hussein 's republican guard . other senior figures include abu ali al-anbari , who currently acts as baghdadi 's deputy leader in syria and is a former military general in hussein 's iraqi army , and abu ayman al-iraqi , a former colonel in iraqi air force intelligence and now plays a leading role in isis ' military council . less prominent militants with an iraqi army backgrounds include abu ahmad al-alwani - a former baathist soldier and now an isis military council member , abu kassem - a former iraqi officer and now in charge of isis suicide bombers and foreign fighters .
