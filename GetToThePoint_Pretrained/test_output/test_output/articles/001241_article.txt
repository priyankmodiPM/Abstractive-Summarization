' we only told ryan at lunchtime that he was playing , we showed him the areas of the park we wanted him to get into and that 's where his first goal came from , ' said the gers boss . ' the kid is a goalscorer and he 's got great energy and good pace . he 's very raw naturally because he 's only young but you ca n't do much more than score two on your debut . ' i 'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that 's him on his way to a lot of goals for rangers . i 'm a horses for courses manager and we 'll change things but ryan did what we hoped he would do and his confidence is high so it 's a nice problem for next week .

' he carries a goal threat and we 're delighted he 's doing that . he got a bit of a roasting at half-time because mark wilson was his man and he switched off . when you play in wide areas you 've got to have the nous and desire to track back . ' he switched off for a second and it landed where he should have been . but we 'll forgive him because of his goal . everyone gives something different to the team but they 're all aware of their responsibilities .
