that claimed the lives of officers rafael ramos and wenjian liu . they were murdered on patrol in brooklyn on december 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide . since that crisis , which threatened to overwhelm the mayor 's agenda , de blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation 's largest police force , brokering a new union contract , investing in new technology and training , and doubling down on his public praise of the department . on monday , he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers ' images were displayed on the park 's giant video screens and again when ramos ' two sons and liu 's widow threw out the pitches to mets players david wright , matt harvey and curtis granderson . de blasio , however , was largely booed when he was

and the number 6 , a tribute to rico petrocelli , a longtime shortstop on de blasio 's favorite team , the boston red sox . petrocelli , like de blasio , was also of italian descent and lived in brooklyn . the tribute to the nypd comes as de blasio is weighing a city council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers . the idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low . but de blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago , pointing to the city 's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere . members of the liu and ramos families are greeted by new york mets ' matt harvey , left , david wright , fourth from left , and curtis granderson , right , after throwing out

william bratton has , at times , signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department , which now has a headcount of about 34,500 , about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001 . de blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago . the council 's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers , to total 1,000 , would cost nearly $ 69m in the upcoming fiscal year . but the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime . new
