harry kane should not go to the under-21 european championship with england this summer , instead saving himself for roy hodgson 's first team , according to kenny dalglish . kane won his first senior caps for england last week , but is still eligible for gareth southgate 's young lions . but dalglish believes he has proven himself capable of making the step up , and should be kept fresh for the full european championships in 2016 . harry kane celebrates after scoring his first england goal , just moments after coming off the bench . kane showed against italy that he can cope with playing against some of the world 's best defenders . kane is ready to be a permanent member of the full squad , rather than the under-21s , says kenny dalglish . ' harry kane doesn’t need to go back to playing under-21 football , ' said dalglish in the mirror . ' he proved that the other night against a defence which included two players from italy’s best team , juventus - he didn’t look bad , did he ? ' ' playing under-21 football this summer won’t help him . it will just tire him out . ' the former liverpool and blackburn boss claimed that the young lions have done their job if they produce a player ready for the first team , and neither kane , nor the other eligible players , should be bounced between the two squads . ' i don’t think the under-21s is there to win tournaments - although it’s nice if you do , and you don’t want to encourage someone that losing is good . ' but it is more important you look at the individual , and if roy hodgson thinks kane is going to be part of his squad for euro 2016 , then that is what they should be gearing towards . ' kane is elligible to play for the young lions at this summer 's tournament , but dalglish says he should n't go . tottenham will be hopeful that their star striker does n't tire himself out playing for both england teams .
