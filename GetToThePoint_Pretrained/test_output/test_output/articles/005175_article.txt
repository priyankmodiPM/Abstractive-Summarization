' a family tragedy ' : mahendra bavishi in khartoum . the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the £60million hatton garden gem heist said yesterday that he believes it was an inside job . mahendra bavishi , who lives in sudan , said detectives have asked to put some ‘sensitive’ questions to his british-based son who runs the business , including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs . and he said the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several cctv cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in . speaking for the first time about the crime mr bavishi , 69 , also told of his fury at police for ignoring an alert from a state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were forcing their way into 72 safe deposit boxes during the easter holiday . he described the robbery as a ‘tragedy’ for his family after the business had just started to make a small profit following years of losses . mr bavishi is a joint director of hatton garden safe deposit ltd with eldest son manish bavishi , who lives in kenton , north-west london , and usually runs the business full-time . but when the robbery happened manish , 38 , was on a month-long holiday with his wife and child in sudan . in his absence , the business was being managed by younger brother alok , 29 . their downcast father told the daily mail : ‘ to many this robbery is like something out of a hollywood fiction film , but to my family it is a tragedy . it is the end of the business my son has worked so hard to build slowly over the last seven years . ‘ it was making a loss when he bought it and only first made a profit last year , and even then it was very little . before then we were relying on loans from banks as we worked to make it a success . now the business is finished . who will trust their valuables with us after this ?
