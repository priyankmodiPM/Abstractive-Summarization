more than 50,000 britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder . the news comes as david cameron today reiterates his pledge to offer the cut-price properties to 200,000 young first-time buyers . the project , launched last month , is part of a dramatic extension of the help to buy scheme – and doubles the number of new starter homes in england from 100,000 to 200,000 . help to buy : the extension to the scheme has been well-received with 50,000 people registering interest in the scheme since it launched last month . the properties would be at prices 20 per cent cheaper than their market value and reserved purely for first-time buyers under the age of 40 . mr cameron will say today : ‘ home ownership goes to the heart of our political beliefs . it’s simple : we believe having a home of their own gives people and families independence ; it helps people stand on their own two feet ; and it’s one of the ultimate symbols of a country where if you work hard , you can get on . ’ figures published yesterday reveal 52,000 people have already registered an interest since the scheme was launched last month . the 20 per cent discount is possible because the new properties will be exempted from taxes and reduced construction costs thanks to the release of cheaper , brownfield commercial land to build on . affordable homes : 50,000 britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder . as well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home , tory strategists believe it will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families’ prospects of ever getting onto the property ladder . each starter home will cost no more than £250,000 outside london and £450,000 in the capital . first-time buyers will also be able to combine the 20 per cent discount with a help to buy mortgage – which offers homeseekers a 20 per cent government-backed equity loan . the help to buy equity loan scheme was introduced in 2013 to offer buyers a 20 per cent government loan to buy new properties , worth up to 95 per cent loan to value . it was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020 . under labour , housebuilding fell to levels not seen since the 1920s . the number of first time buyers also collapsed , falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009 . although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to june last year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the government says far more must be done . but shadow housing minister emma reynolds criticised the government’s record on home ownership , adding : ‘ warm words from david cameron about home ownership will ring hollow for those young people and families who have been priced out of home ownership over the past five years . ’
