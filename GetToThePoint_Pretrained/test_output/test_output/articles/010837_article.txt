some tour guides will do anything for a good tip . in the australian outback , if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local emus , you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently . in a video posted online by youtube user ratbag nomad , one man , referred to as australianwidefishingguide , shows tourists how it 's done . emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of australia . as the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air , the mob of emus started coming closer . and closer . the video , filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush , shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance . peddling his legs to the sky , he looks like something between an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach . sure enough , the emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what 's going on , then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat . a good leg in the air does the trick . as the guide leapt to his feet , the inquisitive birds scattered . it 's thought to be an old aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils . emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary . capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour , they 're said to be able to ' run the pants off a kangaroo . ' the manoeuvre is thought to be an old aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot .
