' it was the 20-year anniversary of the invasion of poland which kickstarted the second world war and so eisenhower gathered all the military leaders for what used to be known as a ' stag party ' . ' the group got together for official photos to be taken but it appears like churchill might have partaken in some daytime drinking because he nodded off while sat right next to eisenhower . ' churchill was fond of a drink while he was in office , and his habit was probably much worse once he retired . ' the photos show one of the other guests dutifully prodding churchill to wake him up , and the former prime minister looking a little bemused . ' the other interesting thing about this set is that all the big british players from the allied high command were at this dinner , including field marshal montgomery . ' monty had been very critical of eisenhower in the years following the war , and it was no secret that they did n't like each other , but he was duly invited to the dinner . ' newspaper reports of the dinner noted that the pair sat close to one another and while no-one knows what was said they seemed to have buried the hatchet . ' the auction will take place on april 15 .
