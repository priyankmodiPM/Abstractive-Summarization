a trucker has been caught on camera launching an extraordinary foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist after a crash along the m6 . in footage shot from a dashboard camera on sunday , the trucker lets rip after a car towing a caravan moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide . eventually the car towing the caravan jackknifes , coming to rest across the front of the van , blocking the slip road - believed to be junction 8 with the m5 , near birmingham . this is the moment a van driver unleashes a foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist ( pictured ) after the man moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide , ending with the car stopped across the lorry 's bonnet . as the footage begins it shows the car indicating to turn into the slip road , before moving across , despite there being little or no space between the van and the car in front . the footage was posted on shropshire-based facebook user mark hazell 's account and was viewed around 2million times in less than 48 hours before being removed . as the car driver got out to survey the scene , the trucker ranted : 'f****** w***** . what the f*** are you doing coming over on me ? ' what are you doing , you f******* idiot , you come over on me ? you had no ... ..cos you indicate , you had no f****** gap ? where were you ? were you in front of me ? you d******* . ' with his turn-off rapidly approaching , the car driver makes a dive for the inside lane , moving across the path of the van before the two vehicles collide with one another . the car momentarily disappears from view before a loud crunching noise is heard , and the car spins around to stop up against the van 's bonnet ( pictured ) . after the accident , blocked the slip road , the car driver ( pictured here wearing the striped top ) jumps out to argue , with the van driver sending a torrent of abuse back . the heated swearing tirade continued before the trucker told the driver : ' i 've got it all on camera . good . the f****** idiot , absolute f****** idiot . ' the crash happened on a stretch of the m6 hit by speed restrictions and lane closures because of roadworks . responding to comments left on facebook , mr hazell said he had two more videos of the crash which he would hand over to police .
