' other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom , and special mood lighting . the bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine , while right , the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . the lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind , fall asleep and even adjust time zones . on boarding the aircraft , a soft ' rose champagne ' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey . this then changes into ' purple haze ' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into ' amber warmth ' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining . to help passengers drift into a deep sleep , ' silver moonlight ' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky . virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent wi-fi . one of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social . two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other , we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar . colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting . the innovative fixtures will be featured on all virgin atlantic 's 787 dreamliner routes .
