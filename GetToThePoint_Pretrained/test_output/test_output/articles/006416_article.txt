there 's not been a lot to laugh about this season at doncaster rovers . an uninspired campaign has seen the yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in league one . saturday 's visit of fleetwood town , who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated , hardly promised to be a thriller . doncaster 's league one encounter against fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . doncaster 's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . and so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the keepmoat stadium . it left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club 's youtube channel . so they made it short and sweet , just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action . just enough time for the kick off , a goal kick and the final whistle . a must-see video for all football fans . the managers on the touchline during saturday 's goalless draw at the keepmoat stadium .
