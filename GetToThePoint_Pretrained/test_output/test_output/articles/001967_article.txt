charlie austin is being considered for a surprise england call up for the national team’s summer fixtures after scoring 17 goals for relegation-threatened qpr . austin is in contention because harry kane , who scored on his debut against lithuania last month and made his first start against italy in turin , will be with gareth southgate’s under-21 team . the qpr striker will continue to be monitored by england head coach roy hodgson and assistant ray lewington ahead of the friendly with republic of ireland on june 7 and the euro 2016 qualifier in slovenia seven days later . charlie austin , in action against chelsea on sunday , has scored 17 times for queens park rangers this term . england manager roy hodgson poses for a selfie at the parc des princes on wednesday evening . hodgson has an established attack with wayne rooney , danny welbeck and daniel sturridge , when fit , but the unsuccessful trial of theo walcott up front in italy has forced them to look elsewhere . england’s head coach , who was in paris on wednesday night to watch the champions league clash at the parc des princes with barcelona , has been impressed with austin this season . despite qpr’s battle against relegation , austin has been consistent throughout and he is now firmly in contention for england’s summer schedule . austin ( second right ) scores for queens park rangers against aston villa earlier this month . austin , celebrating his strike against villa , will be monitored by hodgson for the remainder of the campaign . the qpr forward has to resolve his own future at the end of the season after talks over a new contract at loftus road were put on hold until the end of the season . hodgson’s side have a 100 per cent record in the euro 2016 qualifiers , but it has emerged he is now looking at his options ahead of a squad announcement next month .
