' obviously i would n't inform other people to do it . it was just spur of the moment . it 's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback . ' i 'd had a few drinks , i was happy and reading were winning and i just went for it and had a laugh . it was brilliant . ' asked whether he goes to many reading matches , he added : ' that was my first game actually . it was a good experience . obviously being there on the first game - not after what i 've done , but standing in the stadium , watching the game from the stadium - it 's a brilliant experience .
