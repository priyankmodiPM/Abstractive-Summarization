david luiz could be a doubt for paris saint-germain 's champions league clash with barcelona after picking up a hamstring injury on sunday . the brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of psg 's 3-2 win over marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg . shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash , the brazilian was running away from a marseille player , before being caught by a stray leg . david luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays , but one such run led to his injury . the brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . the former-chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward , but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later . the club 's official english twitter account confirmed it was a muscle pull , tweeting : ' @ davidluiz_4 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull # ompsg ' . reports suggest the 27-year-old will have scans on monday to assess the extent of the injury . if it is serious as suggested then luiz will surely be a doubt for psg 's upcoming games with saint-etienne , bastia and barcelona , whom the french side face in the first leg of their champions league quarter-final on april 15 . in his absence the french champions looked less than assured , conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after luiz departed , but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second-half display . luiz limped off , and could now be a doubt for the champions league quarter-final against barcelona . psg will hope their star defender can recover quickly , as he is a key part of their plans .
