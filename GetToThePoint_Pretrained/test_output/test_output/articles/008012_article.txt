' i have a video of you walking away from your car on numerous occasions , you are not handicapped ! the next time you park here i will forward the video 's to police with your license plate number . you should be ashamed of yourself ! ! ! ! , ' reads one of the fuming letters hope-simpson received . scroll down for video . hidden disability : if natasha hope-simpson was n't holding a cane in this photograph , one might not be able to tell she was missing a part of her leg because she wears a prosthetic limb that helps her walk . flattering note : even though this letter left for natasha hope-simpson on her windshield is filled with venom and anger , she viewed it as flattering because someone could not tell she was missing her leg . hope-simpson became disabled after her leg was crushed in a tragic hit-and-run accident in 2013 and she lost a part of her left leg below the knee . she has a handicap permit on her car but that was not enough to convince a furious onlooker that hope-simpson has a true handicap .

' it 's really none of our business whether they run out of the car , or crawl out of the car . great example is people who live with fibromyalgia — chronic pain — it is episodic , meaning it comes and it goes , ' she says . she says even someone with a disability like fibromyalgia who looks normal may be fine one day and not be able to lift their arms the next . hope-simpson says she does n't know how many times she has been recorded or who left her the note but it seems as though she has managed not to put too much weight on the incident . all types of disabilities : natasha hope-simpson , pictured with a friend , has a disability but because her prosthetic leg was covered , someone thought she was lying about being handicapped .
