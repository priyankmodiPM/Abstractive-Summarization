manchester united fear daniel levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in hugo lloris . and their worries look set to be realised with spurs planning to slap a £35million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors , while the north london club are determined not to sell the frenchman to a domestic rival . united are considering a move for the france goalkeeper as fears grow over a david de gea 's future , while he is also a long-term target for paris saint-germain . hugo lloris has established himself as one of the premier league 's top keepers with some fine displays . spurs are determined to keep lloris at white hart lane and will put a £35million price tag on his head . but spurs are determined to keep their no 1 at white hart lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper . the current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the £32.6million juventus paid parma for gianluigi buffon in 2001 . but tottenham chairman levy values lloris even higher than that fee and wo n't consider any offers for a penny under £35million . and it is for that reason united , despite their interest , are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch . daniel levy ( right ) , alongside spurs owner joe lewis , is known to drive a hard bargain . gianluigi buffon is the world 's most expensive keeper after his £32.6m move from parma to juve in 2001 . levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in europe and will not let lloris leave on someone else 's terms . his reputation for getting maximum value from the club 's assets was underlined when real madrid paid a world record £85million for gareth bale after a summer of hardball tactics from levy . and the spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep lloris , who signed a five-year deal last summer .
