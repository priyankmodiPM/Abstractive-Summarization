( cnn ) the night before her daughter 's first triathlon , kate parker could tell the child was nervous . ella and her younger sister , alice , are athletic , loud , curious , wild-haired kids . they grew up watching their mother compete in races and ella had asked to sign up for her own . still , as they laid out everything she 'd need the next day , parker , a photographer , could tell she was afraid . `` why do n't we get a picture ? '' parker asked ella , now 9 . `` show me your strongest face , show me your bravest face , even if you do n't feel that way right now . '' as she pulled the image up on her screen , she got chills from her daughter 's direct stare . she looked , parker said , like `` a little badass . '' `` you 're going to be totally fine , '' parker showed her . `` look at how tough you are . '' the next day , ella participated in her race , and loved it . looking back , `` i wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it , sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear , `` said parker , who lives near atlanta . `` as a mom , i really wanted to get a good picture of it , too . '' the photo is one of parker 's favorites from her series , `` strong is the new pretty . '' it covers the last two years , but evolved from parker 's early days behind a camera , when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition . it seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows , forced smiles and photoshop-smooth skin . hers did n't . `` i did n't want to shoot pictures like that . i did n't want girls to think they had to look like that , '' said parker , whose daughters are now 6 and 9 . `` whoever they were , however they were , was worthy of an image . whatever they were was good enough . '' so , she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled , muddy , screaming , laughing , jumping in the pool , collecting worms in the creek , barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles . `` i want to capture them before they lose that sense of ' i 'm so awesome . ' i wanted them to keep that as long as they could , '' parker said . `` i started to shoot with that in mind , but it was already there . '' the girls pose for an occasional portrait , but most are kid-inspired moments , shaped by childish wonderment and energy . as parents , parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside , make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair , parker said . now , the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own . `` they 're just being themselves , and i 'm just recording it , '' parker said . responses to the images are mostly positive , parker said , but there 's the occasional complaint that she 's showing just one type of girl . it 's true , parker said : they 're the ones she 's raising , the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7 . she hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children 's lives . more important , she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be . parker 's own kids still surprise her . `` alice is a beautiful singer . when i hear her sing , it makes me cry , '' parker said . `` ella has this amazing , kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win . it 's something that i did not teach her . `` whatever it is , it 's ok .
