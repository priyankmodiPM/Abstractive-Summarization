jurgen klopp rejected the overtures of west ham united after handing in his notice at borussia dortmund . no matter , it was worth a try . now on to the next one . if rafael benitez wants to return to english football after leaving napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic olympic stadium in a year 's time . west ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture . sam allardyce is n't that man . he had his chance and did not take it . allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club , but the momentum of his season changed on boxing day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at chelsea , and lost . sam allardyce is not the man to lead west ham into their new exciting adventure at the olympic stadium . allardyce ( left , pictured behind manchester city manager manuel pellegrini ) has not been up to scratch . click here to read chief sports writer martin samuel 's brilliant column on jack grealish . the folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the christmas period was exposed as west ham then played two home fixtures , losing to arsenal and drawing with west brom . if west ham had maintained their form going into the chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league . had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom . allardyce 's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival , but since christmas west ham have been playing relegation football . if a new manager is being considered , it is understandable . west ham must go to the olympic stadium with more on their minds than survival . rafael benitez could return to english football after napoli and may be persuaded by the hammers project .
