it was meant to be the ultimate symbol of menace : carving '666 ' into his forehead . but in a phenomenal case of idiocy , convicted murderer nikko jenkins used a mirror - so the numbers came out backwards . the symbol is described in the biblical book of revelation as ' the sign of the beast ' , and has since been popularized by the horror movie the omen . however , with a series of upside-down 9s , jenkins has fashioned himself an entirely unique - and irreversible - engraving . botched : nikko jenkins ( pictured in 2014 ) recently tried to carve '666 ' into his forehead but did it backwards . according to omaha.com , jenkins told his attorney about the incident in a phone call from his cell in omaha , nebraska . it comes amid the 28-year-old 's ongoing appeal that he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty . jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison . during his murder trial in douglas county , jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was ' a psychopath ' and ' one of the most dangerous people ' he had ever encountered . ' psychopath ' : the 28-year-old , who a doctor described as ' one of the most dangerous people ' he had ever encountered , may use the botched case of self-mutilation as evidence he is mentally unstable . jenkins pleaded not guilty , then guilty , then ineligible for trial on the grounds of insanity . however , a judge dismissed the appeals and he was sentenced to life . the decision of whether he would be sentenced to death was delayed after jenkins revealed he had carved a swastika into his skin . following months of delays , he will face a panel in july to decide his fate . it is believed jenkins may use his latest botched case of self-mutilation as further evidence that he is mentally unstable .
