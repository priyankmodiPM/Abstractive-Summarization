paul smith has landed one of the toughest fights in boxing after finalising terms to face andre ward on june 20 . as revealed by sportsmail , the fight in oakland , california will not be for ward 's wba super-middleweight world title . but it amounts to a huge , albeit daunting , opportunity for smith , who failed in back-to-back challenges for arthur abraham 's wbo belt . paul smith ( left ) has landed a shot at the unbeaten californian andre ward . ward ( right ) has not fought since he beat edwin rodriguez on points in november 2013 . in ward he will face a man who outclassed carl froch in 2011 , but who has been inactive since november 2013 . ring rust from that 17-month spell could be a factor in determining if smith can beat one of the sport 's top pound-for-pound talents , with the 32-year-old saying : ' i can not wait to get back in the ring and test myself against a class act like andre ward . ' i proved that i belong at the top level with my performances against arthur abraham and this is a challenge that i am relishing . andre is a top pound-for-pound fighter and someone i respect a lot , but he has only boxed once in almost three years and i will give it everything i have got . ' i am fresh and confident going into this fight . it 's a massive opportunity for me and one that i took with both hands when it was offered . i have spent a lot of time boxing in the united states and i look forward to returning for this fight . ' ward said : ' i 'm very excited to be coming back on june 20 at oracle arena in my hometown of oakland , which has been a long time coming . i have an extremely tough fighter in front of me in paul smith , who 's looking to pull the upset , but i ca n't let that happen . ' i have to be on my best game to turn smith away and beat him the way i want to beat him . ' ward 's wba world super-middleweight title will not be on the line when he faces smith in june .
