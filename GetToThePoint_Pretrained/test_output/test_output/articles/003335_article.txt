' '' scroll down for video . the stars of martin scorsese 's classic gangster film goodfellas , debi mazar , paul sorvino , robert de niro , ray liotta and lorraine branco ( from left to right ) reunited in new york on saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual tribeca film festival to a close . released in 1990 , goodfellas charts the rise and fall of lucchese crime family associate henry hill , played by liotta , and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980 . scorsese and producer irwin winkler sent video messages to the audience . ' i remember the previews were one of the worst experiences of my life — we had three of them and they were all in california . ... it seemed that the audience had to be prepared for what it was , but there was a lot of controversy , ' said the director . he went on to recall how he and screenwriter nicholas pileggi were no longer welcome at their favorite italian restaurant after the movie - and its depiction of italian-american mobsters - upset the owners . ' remember that nice italian restaurant in tribeca that we used to go to ? and then when the film came out , the owner of the restaurant said we 're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture ? ' said scorsese . throughout the two-and-a-half-hour screening the audience cheered each major character 's first appearance along with iconic scenes like karen hill 's doorbell-yelling session , and memorable lines like henry hill 's opening narration : ' for as long as i can remember , i always wanted to be a gangster . ' afterwards , liotta , bracco , de niro , sorvino and pileggi recalled making the beloved film in a panel discussion moderated by daily show host jon stewart . actress lorriane bracco appeared in goodfellas as henry hill 's wife karen before going on to star as dr. jennifer melfi in the sopranos . paul sorvino , right , who starred as mob boss paul ' paulie ' cicero in the movie , revealed during the q & a that he had come close to quitting just days before filming as he failed to find the character . in the absense of pesci , it was left to liotta , who played mob informant henry hill , to recall how his co-star 's famous ' do i amuse you ' sequence was almost entirely improvised . ' joe was just telling a story in rehearsal about something that happened to him in queens , ' said liotta . ' some guy , who happened to be a connected guy , said , `` you think that 's funny ? '' the scene helped snag pesci his best supporting actor oscar . liotta also recalled a bowling alley meeting with hill , who told the actor he loved the movie . ' the first thing he said was thanks for not making me look like a s***bag , ' said liotta . ' i said , `` did you see the movie ? '' sorvino , who starred as mob boss paul ' paulie ' cicero , then revealed that he had come close to quitting just days before filming . ' i was really lost , what do you do , i called my agent up and said , `` get me out ! , '' said the actor , who told the audiance that he is a ' soft guy ' and nothing like his character . no show : joe pesci , who won an oscar for his turn as tommy devito , did n't show for the 25th year anniversary but sent an email which read 'f*** , f*** , f*** , f***ity f*** , f*** ' , said de niro . twenty five years on : ray liotta and lorriane bracco starred as husband and wife henry and karen hill in martin scorsese 's gangster epic goodfellas , left , and shared a drink at saturday 's reunion , right . robert de niro , who founded the tribeca film festival , arrived at saturday 's screening with his wife grace hightower . ' then i was going to fix my tie and i saw this guy ( in the mirror ) , ' he added , flashing a cold stare . ' and it scared the hell out of me . that 's the guy ! ' also in attendance were several actors who had minor roles in the movie including kevin corrigan and debi mazar , who played sandy , a friend of henry hill 's mistress . earlier on the red carpet , liotta had recalled something scorsese told him before filming began that made him believe he was going to be part of something special . ' he said , ' i want to shoot this like a gangster , '' said liotta . ' '' if i want to freeze frame , if i want to voice over , if i want to whatever ... '' and that 's what he did . it gave him a lot liberty to just be him . ' that mindset paid off . many regard the oscar-nominated mob tale as more than just a great film of the genre , but also one of the greatest movies of all time . scorsese used a compelling narrative with strong visuals married by a powerful rock soundtrack to reinvent the gangster film . ' i do n't know if he reinvented it as much as he just created his own version of it , ' liotta said . sorvino , who portrayed paulie the mob capo that takes liotta 's henry under his wing , thinks scorsese went beyond reinventing the genre . ' it 's not even part of a genre ; it 's like tearing off that wall and taking a look inside to see what it really is , ' sorvino said of the gritty depiction of life as a mid-level mobster . jon stewart , far right , hosted a q & a with the film 's star during which ray liotta , far left , recalled meeting the real henry hill , who thanked him for ' not making me look like a s***bag ' in attendance at saturday 's screening of goodfellas were actors paul sorvino , debi mazar , robert de niro , lorraine bracco and kevin corrigan ( from left to right ) . the 76-year-old actor expressed gratitude to have a part in the film . ' it 's part of the iconography of american film , ' sorvino said . ' it 's one of the three or four greatest movies ever made , and if you get to do that in your career , you 're pretty lucky . ' based on the nonfiction best-seller wiseguy written by nicholas pileggi , the story traces the life of henry hill — a mobster-turned-informant — from his childhood and life of petty crime to rise and fall in the underworld . the film also stars de niro as james ' jimmy the gent ' conway . de niro is one of the film festival 's co-creators . ' the fact that he helped put it together right after 9/11 and bring tribeca back as well as new york — that was just honorable in itself . and to sustain it for so long now , it represents a great thing in movies , that 's great for movies , and a great thing for the city , ' liotta said . de niro , jane rosenthal and craig hatkoff founded the tribeca film festival in 2002 as a means of stimulating the lower manhattan neighborhood after the sepember 11 attacks . but lorraine bracco , who played henry 's wife , karen , thinks the festival did more than revitalize the city . ' it 's for the world to see that we 're still standing strong , ' bracco said . saturday 's screening of goodfellas , staring ray liotta , marked the end of the 14th annual tribeca film festival .
