' pc michelle ingham of greater manchester police said : ' it is difficult to convey the devastating impact these cruel acts have had on these two victims . ' lawrence repeatedly targeted two vulnerable elderly men in the sanctity of their own homes , a place where they should feel safe and where they and their families had worked hard to ensure these two men could still enjoy a high level of independence in their old age . ' as a direct result of what happened here , one of these men has had to move out of his family home , where until this point he had lived happily , and into residential care , which is simply heart-wrenching for both him and his family . ' i hope that today 's sentencing acts as a warning to others who may think they can get away with targeting more vulnerable members in our society - this sort of heinous crime is one that we take extremely seriously and we will do everything in our power to trace those responsible and put them behind bars for their actions .
