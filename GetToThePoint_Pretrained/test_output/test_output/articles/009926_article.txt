when leaving a place of work , most people will usually avoid burning bridges . engineering an amicable exit is common protocol , even when the employee ca n't wait to get the hell out of there . but one disgruntled staff member at an anonymous firm decided to skip the pleasantries and pen an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter announcing their impending departure to bosses . a reddit user wrote an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter to their boss . a reddit user decided that it was a good idea to write a biting leaving note to their boss.it 's not known exactly where the letter is from , but the writer is believed to be america since the american spelling of ‘apologize’ is used and the date is 4/24/15 which is the u.s. way of writing it . in the note , the reddit user passive-aggressively vents their frustration and discontent with the company policies as well as the lack of emopion shown during recent events . throughout the letter , the reddit user repeatedly apologises for a number of unfortunate incidents - all of which seem to be out of their control . they apologise for the death of a step-mother , sickness and subsequent doctor 's appointments . the letter reads : ' i am sorry that my step-mother died so suddenly from cancer . i am sorry that i am not a robot and was emotionally affected by her passing and had to miss work . ' i am sorry that i got sick and had to miss work so that i did n't get anyone else sick . ' i am sorry i work 47.5 hours per week ( without getting paid the overtime that i am legally owed ) for the last 7 months , and thus have little choice but to schedule necessary doctor 's appointments during school hours . ' ' clearly i am a terrible employee , and for that i apologize . i know you hate people telling you how to do your job , but i suggest you start looking for my replacement . immediately . ' although posted with the caption ' two weeks notice ' , the defiant ending of the letter hints at a rather more immediate departure .
