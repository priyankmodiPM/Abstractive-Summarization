' historians estimate up to 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks , an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide . turkey , however , denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated . democratic rep. adam schiff also said he was ' deeply disappointed ' by the president 's decision . ' the united states has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights , for speaking out against atrocity , for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others , ' said schiff .

' i will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was , ' the reality television star said , encouraging turkey to label the killings as a genocide .

' there are so many people who lost their families , and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking—they should never be forgotten , ' she wrote . ' the whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn’t happen again . a million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred , and a country can just pretend like it never happened ? i don’t think that’s right .

' it happened before rwanda , darfur , and the holocaust . maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the armenian genocide , when 1.5 million armenians were massacred .

' ' the kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at turkey 's campaign of genocide denial , ' anca communications director told abc news after the visit . their trip to armenia ' has helped shine a global spotlight ' on the genocide and ' the need for justice for that crime with millions , ' she said . khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home , asking her fan base on twitter to sign a change.org petition ' to bring awareness to the armenian genocide ' by requesting that google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings , april 24 . ' i did ! ! ! ' she said . as of friday the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters , beating its goal of 200,000 names . google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle , however . the white house said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from obama this year , the administration believes its approach is right , ' both for acknowledging the past , and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present .

' he further proclaimed that ' concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it . ' ties that bind : the kardashian family tree that traces back to two molokan armenian families . home : kim kardashian 's ancient ancestors fled the armenian village karakale ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass . genocide : the village of karakale ( pictured in the 19th century ) was among hundreds destroyed as the ottoman empire laid waste to the region . residents - possibly including the kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . disputed : armenian lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th century , with bloody consequences . armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide . turkey rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 armenians and as many turks died in civil strife when armenians rose up against their ottoman rulers and sided with invading russian troops . the fundamental division was religious . armenians are christians , while turks are muslims . the two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years , but the ottoman turks had always been on top . as ottoman rule crumbled , rival nationalisms arose , and the russian empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded . armenians say they were forced from their homes , marched to mass graves and slaughtered . some managed to flee south into modern-day syria and the levant , others to russian-held land which is now modern-day armenia . hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled . the outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed . but the use of the word ' genocide ' is hugely controversial , as turkey - successor to the ottoman empire , and with a huge majority of muslim ethnic turks - rejects the description . armenia , which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the soviet union , has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths . its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred . the province of kars ( above ) , where the kardashians ' roots - and the origin of their name - lies , is almost entirely in turkey . its capital , kars , is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries : it sits on the border but the frontier is closed .
