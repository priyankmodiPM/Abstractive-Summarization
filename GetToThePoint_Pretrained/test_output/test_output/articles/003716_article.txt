' mr abberley 's arms were outstretched , he said : `` you f***ing w*****s , you are just liars '' . ' abberley , who is unemployed , then interjected from the dock , telling the court : ' can i just say for the record i did n't call anyone `` f***ing w*****s '' . i called them `` dishonourable b******s '' . ' ms ramkissoon continued : ' he produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen , causing a loud bang . ' the prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen , but the marbles scattered causing ' distress and shock ' to the people in the gallery .

' your personal view of politicians , whatever they may be , are entirely a matter for you , ' he said . the unemployed 28-year-old was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour . ' but the difficult you have is how you chose to express it , by criminal damage and your antics in the gallery at the house of commons . ' people are entitled to go to that place and listen calmly to that said below . you chose to disrupt them . ' the judge said abberley had caused ' disquiet ' which may force others to think again about attending parliament . ' those that cause disruption at the palace of westminster have a knock-on effect to other freedoms and confidence in going that , and that must be actively deterred . ' the sentences will run concurrently and abberley has been ordered to pay back £500 in compensation at a rate of £5 a fortnight . he will also undergo supervision sessions for two years , mental health treatment for the next year , and pay an £80 victim surcharge .
