' i think itâ€™s sending the right signal , the way this has been resolved , to the world and the country that arkansas understands the diversity of our culture and workforce but also the importance of balancing that with our sincerely held religious convictions , ' hutchinson said . the recently empowered governor also suggested he 'd issue an executive order banning discrimination in the workplace for state employees , according to a cnn report . the two , gop-controlled states were in a frenzy this week to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions . the moves had the direct effect of upsetting gay and lesbian individuals , however , and incited massive protests . after gay rights activists , sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight , both states found themselves in the cross-hairs , and even republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written . republican leaders in the hoosier state conceded this week to critics arguing that their state 's law , signed into effect by governor mike pence a week ago today , inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . ' it was never intended to discriminate against anyone , ' indiana senate president pro tem david long said at a thursday morning at a press conference . indiana house speaker brian bosma , standing alongside long , said , ' hoosier hospitality had to be restored .

' the 180 earned him the mocking of the white house , which described him as a ' previously defiant governor ' who changed his position after a ' bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry . ' pence said thursday he believed the move to change the legislation was in the best way forward for his state . ' there will be some who think this legislation goes too far and some who think it does not go far enough , but as governor i must always put the interest of our state first and ask myself every day , ' what is best for indiana ? ' pence said in a statement . ' i believe resolving this controversy and making clear that every person feels welcome and respected in our state is best for indiana .

' he said during a press conference outside the state capitol . ' that is the challenge we face . making this law like the federal law will aid us in that effort in communication , but also was my original objective from the beginning . ' upon signing the bill thursday , hutchinson said , ' i know it 's been a contentious debate . ' ' we resolved it in an arkansas way and in the right way for our country and for the people of arkansas . ' hutchinson said he recognizes this is not the end of the debate , ' but the fact that it might not solve every problem for everyone probably means it 's a good bill . ' conservative lawmakers said they did n't appreciate the slap in the face from hutchinson , who had said numerous times in the past that he would approve the legislation in its current form when it reached his desk , but they worked to make the necessary adjustments just the same . ' i do n't feel it was right for the governor to say he was going to sign something that he watched all the way through and did n't sign , ' state senator terry rice told arkansas online . ' i know things come up at the last minute but now we have hodgepodged some bills together . ' that sentiment was shared by arkansas family council , a group that favors the law and pushed to get it passed . ' i 'm very puzzled at this point to see why the bill would need to be amended at this late date , considering everybody in the chamber has had a chance to see it , ' jerry cox , the group 's leader , said .
