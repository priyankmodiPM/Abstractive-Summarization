' in november 1933 , hugh gray was the first to picture a creature splashing in the water . four stumpy-looking objects on the bottom of the creature 's body appeared to look like appendages , such as flippers , but it was later suggested the creature was a dog , possibly holding a stick . in 1938 , g. e. taylor , a south african tourist , filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film . his picture was declared ' positive evidence ' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist . in 1960 , aeronautical engineer tim dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake . mr dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on his last day hunting for it , and described the object as reddish with a blotch on its side . in may 2007 , gordon holmes , a 55-year-old lab technician , captured video of what he said was ' this jet black thing , about 45ft long , moving fairly fast in the water ' . the film , though , has been cast into doubt . mr holmes has been criticised for claiming the existence of fairies and another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters swimming in the loch . william jobes took what appears to be a close-up of the loch ness monster in 2011 . in february 2012 , a sonar image of a large mystery object deep below the surface of loch ness netted boat skipper marcus atkinson the best nessie sighting of the year award - the first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker william hill . the sonar picture , that shows a large unidentified living object deep underwater , was recorded by loch ness boat skipper marcus atkinson . mr atkinson’s sonar fish-finder device records the width of objects in the depths directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second . an online register lists 1,067 total nessie sightings . the list was created by gary campbell , the man behind the official loch ness monster fan club . but the surgeon 's photograph is among the most famous . a diver from the catlin seaview survey is shown collecting imagery of the loch . it was taken in 1934 by colonel robert kenneth wilson and published in the daily mail on 21 april that year , but was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants , chris spurling , who , on his deathbed , revealed the pictures were staged . the image turned out to be a toy submarine bought from woolworths with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big-game hunter marmaduke wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his search for the beast . adrian shine has been carrying out fieldwork in the highlands since 1973 and has logged more than 1,000 nessie sightings . he said : ' the google project was so cloaked in secrecy , when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the special diving expeditions , for once i had no opinion . ' i 'm so proud to have been part of this initiative and i hope people worldwide enjoy exploring street view to have a look and then be inspired to travel to scotland to discover this area of magical beauty and natural intrigue . ' visitscotland chief executive malcolm roughead added : ' the street view project is hugely exciting and we are delighted the team at google have been as inspired about our monster as the hundreds and thousands of visitors who travel to loch ness every year hoping to catch a glimpse . ' research carried out 20 years ago estimated the nessie phenomenon having an economic impact of £40 million ( $ 59 million ) to the scottish economy . with inflation , this figure would have risen to £60 million ( $ 89 million ) by now . and google said there are more searches for loch ness than there are for other uk institutions like buckingham palace and the peak district . ' wherever you stand on the nessie debate , the legend lives on - even in the digital era . sail across the freshwater lake and take in its haunting beauty , made darker still by the peat particles found in its waters , ' the site continued . ' let the loch unlock the spirit of your imagination , where the rippling water , tricks of the light , and drifting logs bring the legend of nessie to life . ' you can imagine nessie nestling within these dark , peat-filled waters , waiting for the right moment to breach the surface into the scottish sunlight above .
