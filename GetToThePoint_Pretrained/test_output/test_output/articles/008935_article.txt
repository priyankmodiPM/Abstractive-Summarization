' tony hardacre wrote on the page on april 13 , ' been here 47 years what the f*** is going on he is an australian citizen he should be let back into australia ' . vella has regularly returned to malta since he moved to australia and was crowned light heavyweight boxing champion of his homeland in 1978 . true patriot : rebels bikie boss alex vella said he was not a criminal and just wanted to return to australia so he could rejoin his family , run his motorcycle club and continue his charitable good works . sometimes referred to as ' the maltese falcon ' , he has four sons , says he donates generously to charities and is a regular churchgoer . he describes the rebels as ' family ' and a ' brotherhood ' , not a criminal organisation . ' i have always worked hard and given back to community , ' he states on his website . ' i have always voted and paid tax . all i want is to be able to return to my home of 46 years and be reunited with my family . ' the attero task force sees him differently , according to court documents . ' the rebels mc presents a high threat to the australian community , ' the court documents state . ' this omcg has demonstrated an ability to increase its geographical influence , diversify across illicit drug markets and launder illicit profits .

' mr vella acknowledges he is the national president of the rebels mc . he also acknowledges he is aware that several members of the rebels mc have been involved in criminal activities . ' the fact that rebels mc members remain members despite criminal convictions including convictions obtained whilst members of the omcg contradicts mr vella 's assertions the rebels mc does not condone criminal activity by its members , and allow them to remain members .
