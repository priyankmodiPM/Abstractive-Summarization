peter scudamore rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by ap mccoy . here , he identifies what he believes are the 10 finest achievements of saturday 's retiring champion . 1 riding his 4,000th winner at towcester on november 7 , 2013 . he has won virtually every big race in the calendar but mccoy’s greatest feat has to be the immense tally of winners he has ridden . to put his numbers into perspective , in the all-time list of successful jockeys , great rival richard johnson is closest to him and the gap is around 1,500 winners . tony mccoy celebrating after he won his 4,000th race on board mountain tune at wetherby in 2013 . 2 his 20 straight jump jockey titles . if you like your champions dominant , you have to love mccoy . no modern sportsman can match his reign . he outstrips 16-time darts world champion phil taylor by almost 200 weeks , with a staggering 1,040 weeks at the top . that compares to 364 for formula one’s michael schumacher and 302 for tennis ace roger federer . 3 winning the 1994-95 conditional jockeys championship . mccoy hit the ground running on his arrival in britain from ireland , landing the apprentice title for jumps jockeys with a record 74 wins . not surprisingly , it is another mccoy record which still stands . 4 record 290 winners in a season ( 2001-02 ) the 300-winner season mccoy craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in britain and one abroad . his feat outstripped the european record of german peter schiergen ( 271 in 1995 ) and sir gordon richards’ best of 269 in 1947 . 5 winning bbc sports personality of the year in 2010 . not to be underestimated . frankie dettori and lester piggott are household names but neither of those great jockeys won this prestigious title . mccoy’s prodigious achievements have transcended racing’s usual boundaries and his peerless career has gained the respect it deserves . mccoy stands proud with his sport personality of the year award in birmingham in 2010 . 6 don’t push it’s 2010 grand national win . picking out even a handful of mccoy’s best wins is an exercise in subjective futility . we all have our favourites but don’t push it’s victory at aintree was arguably the most significant on the greatest stage . plenty of top jockeys have never had a sniff of the grand national winner’s enclosure . mccoy celebrates aboard grand national winner do n't push it at aintree racecourse in 2013 . 7 worth his weight . unbelievably , given the lengths to which he has gone to control his weight and boil himself down , mccoy has never had to put up overweight ( carry more than his mount was allotted ) . it is another example of his extraordinary self control . 8 breaking my fastest time to 100 winners in a season . i never thought my fastest-to-100-wins record would stand forever but in november 1996 mccoy thrashed my best by 30 days . a season later and he beat his own record by 16 days . this season he set a new best for a fastest ton on august 21 , 116 days into the season . mccoy achieved the fastest ever century of jumping winners at warwick in 1996 on board class of 92 . 9 not just the width , feel the quality . he has not had the consistent big-race firepower of compatriot ruby walsh but 31 winners at the cheltenham festival is still an amazing tally for mccoy and includes three champion hurdles and two gold cups . to put that in perspective , john francome only had 10 festival wins and richard dunwoody 18 , while i had 13 . in all , he rode 196 wins at cheltenham . 10 the worcester source . mccoy has ridden more winners at worcester — 298 from 1,089 rides — than at any course in britain and the venue , while not individually significant , is symbolic . it shows what a force of energy he has been at the mundane weekly meetings . never has his motivation dropped , no matter how small the stage . it is a trait which set him apart . mccoy has ridden more winners at worcester , 298 from 1,089 rides , than at any course in britain .
