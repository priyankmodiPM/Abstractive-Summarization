by the time he reached 17 , there was no room for geoff johnson at home . his mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy , refusing to trash anything ; unable to fix anything . in his senior year , 1995 , it was too much : he moved out . now , two decades later , he and his younger sister jennifer mcshea have returned to the family home in omaha , nebraska - and nothing has changed . geoff , 37 , had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere . jennifer , also 37 , returned just twice , on the advice of her counselor , to confront the deeply-embedded shame she felt . but when their mother passed away following a 12-year battle with breast cancer in 2013 , the house was handed to them . finally returning to the meticulous havoc , they were inspired to create a moving photo-series with their own children to document the reality of being a hoarder 's child . scroll down for video . life as a hoarder 's child : geoff johnson returned to the home of his mother , a compulsive hoarder , 20 years after he left and created a moving series of images about his uneasy upbringing . he did this by superimposing shots of his son onto images of the trash-ridden home in omaha . ' no place for a child ' : his younger sister jennifer , also aged 37 , joined him as they confronted their past after their mother died of breast cancer in 2013 . jennifer 's four-year-old daughter is superimposed onto a shot of the bathroom which has not been touched since they left in 1993 . geoff , a photographer , wanted to picture his son and jennifer 's daughter going about their daily lives among the trash - as they had done years before . but the crumbling house is so unsafe , and their feelings still so raw , that they opted to use photoshop and superimpose the children onto the images . regardless , the highly realistic results strike an uneasy feeling that geoff says was so difficult to come to terms with . ' it is difficult to describe the feeling of shame , the fear of embarrassment that you have growing up with a hoarder , ' geoff , who is still based nearby in omaha , tells dailymail.com . ' people would say `` why did n't you just throw things away ? '' it 's just not as simple as that . hoarders have a deep-rooted sense of attachment to things and it seems crazy but they have a sense of order . ' my sister and i would try to throw things away , but if anything even moved our mom would get very upset . ' going back was an emotional experience . ' when we were kids , i would only ever open the door by a crack when people came by . we never had people over . ' it 's a complex issue ' : geoff said people have since asked him why they did n't just throw things away . he said the issue was deeper than that and his mother had a deep-rooted attachment to every little piece of the havoc . but as a child it was difficult to understand . ' sense of perspective ' : jennifer said the pictures have helped her to see that the home she felt so uncomfortable in was no place for children . jennifer 's bedroom : jennifer made clear that she did not want the children to enter the crumbling house , which is filled with mold , as it is unsafe and also occupies a difficult emotional space for her . she wants her daughter to know that she would never put her in that situation . breaking point : geoff moved out when he was 17 in 1995 when a pipe burst during the winter . ' there was no heating and i had to be responsible . it was the hardest thing i had had to do in my life up until that point and i could n't take it any more , ' he said . ' things would break and never be fixed . we did n't have a working refrigerator - we would leave food on the back porch in the winter , and get a cooler in the summer , but that would break too . ' i had to leave in january of my senior year because the pipes broke . it was so cold , there was no heating , and i was just 17 . it was the hardest thing i 'd had to do in my life up until that point ; to be the adult , be responsible . it was too much for me , so i left . ' jennifer was already long-gone by that point . just 19 months younger than geoff , she left when she was 15 in 1993 , to live with their father in the same village . she did n't return until she finished college in 2001 . ' i was going through counseling , and discovered that the house was a big part of the issues i was dealing with , ' jennifer , based in florida , told dailymail.com . ' my counselor said i should go back , and take friends to confront the feeling of embarrassment . it was that feeling that people did n't know about that side of our lives . we never let anyone in , and then we left it behind . feeling of shame : in this image ( left ) geoff is recreating the way he would hide behind the door when people came to visit , and never let people come to visit . jennifer returned to the house when she finished college on the advice of her counselor to confront the feeling of shame . unmoved : they photographed the scene completely untouched when they returned to clean it up after their mother passed away . the moment they returned together was important for them , they said . they both knew what each other had gone through as kids . ' the first time i stepped in there , the memories washed over me . it was hard . my mom was n't there , but she had given me permission to go . ' my two friends came in after me , they were supportive and gracious , but i could tell they were also taken aback by it all . ' a few years later , she returned again with the man that would become her husband . and finally , in 2013 , she and geoff returned together . ' it was a really important moment for both of us i think , ' she told dailymail.com . ' to be there with someone who knew what you had gone through . we could talk about memories , and now that we 're both parents we could reflect on how it affected us . placing their children in the frames was a cathartic experience that , jennifer says , helped her fully understand how she had been affected . ' seeing my own daughter sat there in my room , even though she was n't actually there , was a really big thing for me . ' you see it from an outside perspective : this is no place for a child . ' i do n't think we really knew at the time . for children , it is an enormous , complex , emotional concept to get your head around . ' the pair made clear that they continued to have a relationship with their mother until the day she died . it was the house , however , that left them with such difficult feelings . ' my mom worked hard , she had multiple jobs and children . i do n't blame her for that , ' geoff says . ' but it was difficult for us . '
