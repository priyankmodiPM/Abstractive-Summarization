a saudi arabian citizen has captured intense footage of a sandstorm sweeping its way across a street , engulfing everything in its path . sandstorms caused havoc in saudi arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close . car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the arabian peninsula were plunged into darkness . strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption , which resulted in nearby dubai’s skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems . the footage , captured on camera in saudi arabia by mohammed mohsen , shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed . like the aftermath of an explosion , the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward . mohammed mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . the orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire arab state . getting thicker , the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further sunlight becomes drastically reduced . a number of people stand alongside the video maker , staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones . the video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud , which he is now very much encapsulated within . mohammed mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . last week the storm filled saudi arabia’s air before spreading across the peninsula into the united arab emirates , oman and yemen . despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world , they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc . many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences .
