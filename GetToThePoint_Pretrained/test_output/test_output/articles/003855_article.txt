nisour square slaughter that left 14 dead and dozens more maimed and injured . dustin heard , paul slough and evan liberty ( clockwise from top left ) were received the 30-year minimum sentences plus one day for their multiple manslaughter convictions . u.s. district judge royce lamberth on monday rejected a defense motion to impose lesser sentences on the four , as well as a motion by prosecutors to increase the penalties . lamberth deferred formally imposing the sentences while hearing arguments from both sides on the sentencing . defense lawyers argued for mercy but prosecutors said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility . all four were convicted in october for their involvement in the killings that caused an international uproar in nisoor square , a crowded traffic circle in downtown baghdad . the legal fight over the killings has spanned years . prosecutors have described the shooting as an unprovoked ambush of civilians , though defense lawyers countered that the men were targeted with gunfire , and shot back in self-defense . dozens of iraqi witnesses to the bloody september day in baghdad volunteered to travel to washington to testify against the former guards , the new york times reported . they described to jurors a scene of absolute horror , one that came as if out of the clear blue . they said they took cover after hearing machine-gun fire start ring after four american armored vehicles rolled into busy nisour square . a traffic officer who was on the scene described watching a woman cradle her dead son in her arms before she , too , was murdered by blackwater guards . mandatory minimums : a man caring a poster that reads ' approximate locations of victims around nisoor square ' enters the e. barrett prettyman federal courthouse in washington on monday . u.s. district judge royce lamberth on monday rejected a defense motion to impose sentences lesser than mandatory minimums on the four . family members , friends and supporters

prettyman federal courthouse in washington in support of the men awaiting sentencing . ‘ there was a lady . she was screaming and weeping about her son and asking for help , ’ sarhan deab abdul moniem said through an interpreter . ‘ i asked her to open up the door so i could help her . but she was paying attention only to her son . ’ majed salman abdel kareem al-gharbawi , 55 , described being shot in the gut and slumping to the ground alongside another wounded man . ‘ he was screaming and praying to god , for allah to save him from this calamity , ’ gharbawi testified . ‘ so i told him , let’s do that together . ’ gharbawi stayed down as the other man decided to make a run for it—a decision that cost the man his life . ‘ his body was shaking violently as the bullets were piercing him and hitting the sidewalk , ’ gharbawi said . according to the times , the blackwater guards continued shooting into the man’s body well after he was clearly dead . the defense argued for mercy monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful , war-torn environment , and who have proud military careers and close family ties . the firearms convictions alone carry mandatory minimum sentences of 30 years in prison . the government sought sentences far beyond that , partly because it said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility . bloodbath : an iraqi woman peeps inside the blood stained car of two women allegedly shot dead by private security guards in central baghdad . dozens of iraqi witnesses would later volunteer to testify about the atrocities they saw that day . murdered : a picture shows the blood stained and bullet riddled car of two women allegedly shot dead by blackwater guards . one witness would later describe watching a woman cradle her dead , bullet-riddled son before she was murdered at his side . unimaginable : hair is seen on the bullet riddled and blood stained windshield of a car of two women shot dead . one witness said he watched a man bolt for his life only to be riddled with bullets before guards continued to fire at his clearly dead body . the sentencing is unlikely to bring an end to the legal wrangling , which began even before the guards were first charged in 2008 . a judge later dismissed the case before trial , but a federal appeals court revived it and the guards were indicted again in october 2013 . even before the trial began , defense lawyers had identified multiple issues as likely forming the basis of an appeal , including whether there was proper legal jurisdiction to charge them in the first place . the statute under which they were charged , the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act , covers the overseas crimes of defense department civilian employees , military contractors and others who are supporting the american war mission . but defense lawyers note that the blackwater defendants worked as state department contractors and were in iraq to provide diplomatic , not military , services . the legal fighting continued in the days leading up to sentencing , too , with defense lawyers seeking friday to postpone the hearing after receiving new information — a victim impact statement from a trial witness — that they said was favorable to the defense . but lamberth denied the request , saying there was no need to delay the sentencing . wartorn : the defense argued for mercy monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful , war-torn environment . self defense ? guards say they first fired under the belief that a car heading toward their convoy was rigged with a bomb .
