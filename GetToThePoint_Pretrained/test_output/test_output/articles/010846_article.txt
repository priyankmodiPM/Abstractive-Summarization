' he continued : ' our study , which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure , found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement .

' i set myself a goal , and my continual motivation is achieving that goal , because i know that it will all be worth it if i just put effort into it now . ' personally , i don’t really benefit from timetables as i fear that if i am not strictly adhering to them , i am somehow not effectively revising . ' but i definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest , and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time . i would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students . ' ' although my family has n't offered me treats if i do well , i have promised myself them ! during my as exams i really wanted a kindle , so i told myself that as soon as i got through the tough exams i’d treat myself to one .
