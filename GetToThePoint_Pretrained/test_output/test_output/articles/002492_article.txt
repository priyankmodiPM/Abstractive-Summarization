' i wo n't talk about the referee , but i think referees from minor leagues should not be in charge of this kind of game , ' miranda told as . ' we had chances to win but madrid also had theirs . we had a very bad first half and we were better in the second . ' now we have to go get the win [ in the second leg ] . it 's a tough game and we will go for the win . we can qualify by scoring a goal . ' miranda is not the only atletico madrid star to hit out at mazic as team-mate mario suarez has also taken a swipe at the serbian official . suarez expressed his frustration after the game , saying on spanish tv : ' the referee is very bad . they ca n't use a serbian referee for these type of games , with all my respect .
