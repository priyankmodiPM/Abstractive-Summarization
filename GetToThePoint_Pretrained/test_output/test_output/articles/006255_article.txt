' the dreaded diagnosis came after glenna , at just 22 , discovered a golf ball-sized lump in her groin while working out at the gym one day . she would eventually see a doctor and get a biopsy . physicians would trace the cancer back to a mole glenna had removed years earlier , but which doctors had failed to identify as melanoma . by then , she already had stage iii melanoma . but glenna was prepared to fight . ' whatever i have to do to fight cancer , i 'll do , ' her father bob recalls his daughter saying . because the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system , doctors removed 13 lymph nodes from her groin . less than a year later , glenna found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage iv . glenna was given more powerful drugs , but the cancer continued to spread . she tried experimental treatments with terrible side effects , but they were no use . glenna died in november 2008 , three years after her diagnosis -- and her final tanning session .
