ronald koeman believes southampton will have to win their six remaining games to stand any chance of reaching the champions league . this has been a remarkable season at st mary 's , with the club already having levelled the record premier league points tally of 56 set last year . that record will no doubt be broken in the coming weeks and things could get better still , with manchester city 's sudden drop-off opening up the potential for a top-four finish . southampton boss ronald koeman believes his side must win their last six games to finish inside top four . saints remained in the hunt for a place in next season 's champions league by beating hull at st mary 's . southampton are five points behind man city . saints have five points to claw back on the reigning champions but koeman believes it is possible if they win all their remaining games . ' normally yes , ' the dutchman said . ' the distance is five points . we need to win i think all . ' they ( city ) do n't lose three games , no . they have the next two at home . normally , with the players that they have , the qualities . ' you never know , but it 's all about to win the last six to have really a good chance to be one of the top four teams . ' saints travel to the etihad stadium on the final day of the season and , by contrast to the other sides chasing a top-four berth , have a kind set of fixtures before that . tottenham and aston villa come to st mary 's , while trips to sunderland , leicester and city follow saturday 's match at stoke . southampton striker graziano pelle scored in his side 's 2-0 premier league win over hull . stoke vs southampton - april 18 . southampton vs tottenham - april 25 . sunderland vs southampton - may 2 . leicester vs southampton - may 9 . southampton vs aston villa - may 16 . manchester city vs southampton - may 24 . ' yeah , but in the last part of the season , ok , what 's the best to play against ? ' koeman asked . ' a team who 's fighting for no relegation or two teams who are fighting for the title ? i do n't know . ' every game is difficult . you have to be on your level to win a game . all are difficult . ' we play sunderland away , we play leicester away and they 're fighting for not going down and that 's even difficult . ' koeman is certainly not taking the run-in lightly and the trip to the britannia stadium will be an interesting test for southampton 's players at this stage . ' it is a difficult one , ' the dutchman said . ' we have that experience this season two times we play stoke , one time at home and one time away for the league cup . ' both games we won but in both it was difficult because we know the qualities of them . ' we know the manager was always with the high spirit , the high intention in the game , physical players , direct game . ' maybe we are lucky to play this weekend there , with the temperature and weather but i know it 's always windy and that makes it still more difficult . ' the weather will be good this weekend and circumstances good for the weekend . '
