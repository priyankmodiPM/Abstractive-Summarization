a farmer from eastern china has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs . the 20-day-old ' spider goat ' - as it has been ( inaccurately ) nicknamed by chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs . xiao qibin , owner of the farm , said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with ' an extraordinary appetite ' , the people 's daily online reports . rare : this six-legged kid has become a star animal in china since it was born 20 days ago . mr xiao started running his goat farm in chaohu in anhui province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats . ' during the labour , i saw the nanny goat was having difficulty , ' said mr xiao . ' i saw two legs came out at first , but surprisingly another four followed when the kid was fully born , ' he added . mr xiao said at first he was n't sure if the mutant goat - which weighed 5kg at birth - would survive . however , the kid is healthy and growing quickly - and has become one of the most playful goats on the farm . ' he can eat a lot , ' added the farmer . playful : miss ge , an employee at xiao qibin 's farm , takes care of the playful baby goat every day . the kid 's six legs were of similar length initially , but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground . mr xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal ' lake goats ' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation . he said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs . ' i want him to grow up naturally and happily , ' said mr xiao . healthy : mr xiao said the goat is growing quickly and has become one of the most playful animals on the farm .
