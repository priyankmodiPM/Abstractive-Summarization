alvaro morata wants to continue his development at juventus and has no interest in rejoining real madrid , according to his agent beppe bozzo . the 22-year-old joined the italian giants for £15.8million last summer after failing to break into the real first-team on a regular basis . morata signed a five-year deal at the juventus stadium after starting just three games in la liga for real during the 20113-14 campaign . alvaro morata is happy at juventus and has no interest in joining real madrid , according to his agent . and the spain international has impressed since moving to turin - having netted seven goals in 22 serie a matches so far this season . madrid have a buy back option on the forward but bozzo insists morata is keen to fulfill his five-year deal at the juventus stadium and develop as a player . ' the situation just now is very favourable for juve . when it comes to important players like him , we almost always have the last word , regardless of clubs or clauses , ' bozzo told tuttosport . ' morata is fine at juve , he is not thinking about anything else . it all depends on what the player wants , just as it was when he decided to leave madrid a year ago . morata ( left ) started just three la liga games for real last season - in a season of limited opportunities . ' alvaro is not a hypocrite , he says what he thinks . he will not have a foot in both camps . a few days ago he said that juve is fine and that he is n't thinking of returning to madrid ; he wants continue to grow with juve . even to me he has always expressed the same idea . ' no club , not even one as powerful as real , can spend so much money to sign a player who does not want to move . ' he is already worth twice as much as juve spent to buy him - at least €40 ( £29 ) million . ' 22-year-old ( left ) has scored seven goals in 22 serie a matches so far this campaign for juventus .
