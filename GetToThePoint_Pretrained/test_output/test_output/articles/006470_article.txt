this is the moment a driver deliberately blocked a sneaky motorist who tried to beat a traffic jam with an undertaking manoeuvre . traffic had started to build up on the m58 around switch island on merseyside , with one motorist filming the gridlock on a dashcam . but one driver in a silver mercedes obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane , where vehicles were merging . traffic began to build up on the m58 around switch island in merseyside when a silver mercedes attempted to undertake the trafffic . but a renault driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the mercedes from moving forwards . he attempted to sail up the inside lane in a sneaky bid to avoid having to wait . but to his shock , a silver renault then pulls into the inside lane to block the mercedes from advancing any further . not content with having to wait , the mercedes driver the tries to both overtake and undertake the renault in an attempt to get past the vehicle . the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past . the mercedes , behind , is then forced to wait like the rest of the drivers , for 10 minutes as they approach an roundabout . but each time he tries , the renault swerves in the lane blocking the mercedes from passing . the swerving goes back and forwards for over a minute before both drivers wind down their windows to confront each other . the pair can be seen pointing and shouting at each other but despite their argument , neither driver lets up . eventually the mercedes driver catches up to the renault with the man shouting and pointing at the renault driver . this then forces the mercedes to wait 10 minutes in the queue like everybody else before moving back into the correct lane as they approach a roundabout . the incident was captured on a dashcam by a passing motorist and posted to youtube by a user called lancashire dashcam . and despite only being uploaded yesterday , it has already been viewed thousands of times .
