demand for rubber to make tyres is having a ‘catastrophic’ impact on the world’ s forests , scientists have warned . up to 21 million acres of jungle will be torn down to make way for rubber plantations in the next decade alone , according to researchers at the university of east anglia . the demand is putting endangered gibbons , leopards and elephants in south east asia at risk , a study published in the journal conservation letters says . a scene of devastation captured on indonesia 's borneo island . endangered species in south east asia at risk . lead researcher eleanor warren-thomas said : ‘ the tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown , and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations . ‘ but the impact of this is a loss of tropical biodiversity . ‘ we predict that between 4.3 and 8.5 million hectares ( 10.6 - 21 million acres ) of new plantations will be required to meet projected demand by 2024 . the tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown , and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations . ‘ this will threaten significant areas of asian forest , including many protected areas . ’ she said many protected areas have already been lost to rubber plantations - including three-quarters of the snoul wildlife sanctuary in cambodia , which was cleared for rubber between 2009 and 2013 . miss warren-thomas added : ‘ in cambodia , forest areas earmarked for further rubber plantations contain critically endangered water birds like the white shouldered ibis , globally threatened mammals like eld’s deer and banteng , and many important primates and carnivores . ‘ macaques and gibbons are known to disappear completely from forests which have been converted to rubber . ' our review shows that numbers of bird , bat and beetle species can decline by up to 75 per cent . ’
