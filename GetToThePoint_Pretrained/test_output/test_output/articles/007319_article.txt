a man vying to become the next kentucky governor has legally changed his name to gatewood galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes . the 68-year-old pulaski county resident , who was known as terrill wayne newman until tuesday , told the lexington herald-leader he does n't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will ' warm galbraith 's grave . ' his predecessor , who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema , gained a following for his wit , sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana . terrill wayne newman ( right ) , who is vying to become governor of kentucky , has legally changed his name to gatewood galbraith after the late local celebrity ( left ) who bid five times for the title but never won . the newly-christened galbraith filed paperwork on wednesday to run as an independent for the state 's highest office . the secretary of state 's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by august 11 to get their names on the general election ballot . galbraith said he 'll run on a similar platform , but will focus on his namesake . ' i mostly will be talking about the great gatewood galbraith , ' he said . galbraith says he and the late galbraith were ' not friends per se , ' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis . dea riley , who was the original galbraith 's running mate in 2011 , said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing . ' i can hear him now : `` i 'll tell the irs to send him the tax bill , '' ' riley said . but she also said the new galbraith ' has very big shoes to fill ' with his name and she hopes he will honor it . ' to have gatewood 's name and message prostituted , for the sake to garner political office , is a personal affront to me in that i was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant , ' riley said .
