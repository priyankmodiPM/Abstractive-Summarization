' i 'm still right there , ' 14-time major winner woods said of his position going into the weekend . ' i was at a pretty low one ( point ) in my career , ' woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round . ' to basically change an entire ( swing ) pattern like that and put it together , put it in a position where i can compete in a major championship like this is something i 'm very proud of . ' woods , who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change , again struggled with the pace of augusta national 's heavily contoured greens . ' i had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole , ' said woods . ' you expect certain putts to roll out , but they 're not rolling out . ' watched by huge galleries , woods made a fast start , hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of ' watch out , tiger 's back ' and ' come on tiger , let 's go ' rang out . spieth , 21 , broke the 36 hole record on friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament , 12 strokes ahead of woods . his only bogey came at the par-three sixth , his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet . woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style , draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet . he birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway , a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup . ' i 'm still right there , ' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend . ' i 'm 12 back , but there 's not a lot of guys ahead of me . and with 36 holes here to go , anything can happen . '
