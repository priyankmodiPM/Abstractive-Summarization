[ her employer ] rob is a complete d*** ... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need . ' realising her mistake , she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents . ms nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a ' joke within our family ' .

' on the evidence , i am not persuaded that when ms nesbitt referred to mr gardner as `` a complete d*** '' , it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or , that it was `` light-hearted insult '' or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for , ' commissioner dj cloghan said . ' it was far from a `` light-hearted insult '' , it was a hurtful and unpleasant appraisal of [ her employer ] , for whom she earned $ 95,000 per annum . '
