' he would not reveal what item the dna sample was taken from . police say there are plans to swab a number of people who featured in the original investigation , but stress there were ' no suspects , as such ' - there have never been any arrests over the case . instead , mr beirne said he was first appealing to the public to put forward names of anyone they believe may have been involved , who would then be tested . it would then be ' a simple task to either eliminate or implicate people as the source of the dna ' , he added . mr beirne , a retired veteran police officer with more than 30 years experience as a detective , said if nothing useful comes to light then investigators may then look at ' a potential mass screening ' in the area . he said : ' janet 's death left three children without a mother . ' we want to bring justice to janet 's family . ' if people have suspicions , i would urge them to contact police . ' mr beirne added : ' somebody out there knows who killed janet - we 're asking them to make contact . ' also appealing to the public , roxanne brown said : ' we need your help to find them .
