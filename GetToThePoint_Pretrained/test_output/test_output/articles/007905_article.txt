the former head of the nhs warned labour yesterday that its failure to match tory pledges to invest in the health service would leave it in a ‘ financial hole’ . sir david nicholson is the latest expert to warn that ed miliband’s plans will not provide enough cash to keep the service going . he was branded the ‘ man with no shame’ after refusing to resign over the mid staffs scandal which led to 1,200 needless deaths . sir david : the former head of the nhs 's criticism of labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the nhs . published in the daily mail , february 7 , 2013 . the lifelong bureaucrat had led the west midlands strategic health authority , which oversaw mid staffs , before labour appointed him to run the nhs in 2006 . sir david stayed in the top job , insisting he did not know what went on at mid staffs , until retiring in april last year with a pension pot worth almost £2 million . his replacement as chief executive simon stevens drew up a £30billion five-year rescue package called forward view which the conservatives and lib dems have both pledged to implement . it involves the nhs finding £22billion in savings but also needs an extra £8billion funding by 2020 . labour has paid lip service to the plan , promising just £2.5billion . sir david said : ‘ all of the parties now i think , bar labour , have signed up to the £8billion so it’s important , obviously , we get all the political parties signed up . ‘ they haven’t said the £8billion , it would be helpful , i think , for the nhs if they did . ’ his comments add to a chorus of criticism over labour’s health plans . mike dixon , a leading gp and chairman of the nhs alliance , said he was ‘ extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the £8billion funding’ . he added : ‘ nhs leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision . it’s not rocket science to predict the impact on the nhs if this commitment is not met . ‘ patients would face longer waits , services would face severe cuts and rationing , and many hospitals and gp practices would struggle to survive in their current form . ’ health secretary jeremy hunt said labour must explain why it wo n't find the money the nhs ' says it needs ' . chris ham , chief executive of the king’s fund think-tank , said : ‘ the big question is about funding , with labour the only one of the three main parties not to have pledged to find the £8billion in additional funding called for in the nhs five-year forward view . ‘ given this is the minimum if the nhs is to continue to meet patient needs and maintain standards of care , this leaves a significant gap at the heart of its plans . ’ health secretary jeremy hunt said : ‘ labour must explain why they won’t find the money the nhs says it needs . ‘ they don’t have a plan for the economy and that means they’ll never be able to fund the nhs . ’ sir david warned that the scale of the impending cash crisis was so great that the tories and lib dems would have to rein in plans to expand services , despite being committed to the £8billion . his criticism of labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the nhs . the party has run a controversial poster campaign claiming the conservatives would cut the nhs ‘ to the bone’ . but senior figures have confirmed that labour would not match tory spending plans . shadow health secretary andy burnham said a planned shake-up of nhs services by labour meant the ‘ funding gap ... may be smaller’ .
