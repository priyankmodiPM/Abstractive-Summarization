' i came across a youtube video about acid peels so i thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo . the kit cost Â£25 online and i thought `` bargain '' . ' but instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped , jessica 's dangerous diy treatment gave her chemical burns . a chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it 's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way . the body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger . but jessica applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions . as a result , it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister . jessica 's tattoo , left , featuring the name of her ex , and the burns she suffered , right , after applying acid . six painful applications left jessica 's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained . she said : ' it felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it .

' despite her painful first encounter with the acid , jessica repeated the treatment another six times . her skin became red raw , scabby and inflamed - and worst of all , the tattoo was still visible . realising her diy treatments were a painful failure , jessica finally sought the advice of tattoo artist aaron mullen . he said : ' i have never seen anything like it before , my first reaction was shock , she should n't have taken such a drastic measure to use acid on her skin . ' jess , left , regretted getting her ex-boyfriend 's name tattooed on her bikini line , right . he recommended laser removal surgery but said jessica would have to wait until her skin has healed from the acid burns . jessica said : ' i regret doing the acid now as i have made process slower . it will be another six to nine months till it will be completely gone . ' another woman keen to get rid of a tattoo featuring the name of an ex is jess , 23 , a dental nurse , from london . she appears on tlc show extreme beauty disasters this week where she reveals her regrets over her tattoo . ' my boyfriend jack and i got matching tattoos . then we broke up and i 'm left with his name tattooed on me in an awkward position below my bikini line .

' i was in love with him and i thought he was in love with me . we got matching tattoos as we thought we could be together forever , ' she said . ' a year-and-a-half later he decided he wanted to be single when he went to uni and broke up with me . when he broke up with me , i said `` i have your name tattooed on me , what am i going to do ? `` ' jess sought the advice of skin expert dr sam bunting who told her : ' you have two options - one is to get rid of it altogether and that would involve using laser , which is quite a long , painstaking process and will cause some discomfort . ' the other is to change it so the word jack is n't distinguishable . ' jess decided on the latter and enlisted the help of tattoo artist david kaffri , who is no stranger to ridding people of tattoos featuring the name of an ex . he said : ' i like it when people come to me with a tattoo they hate and i can transform it into one they love . ' when i first saw jess ' tattoo , i thought , `` oh my god that 's a bad mistake '' . the `` jack '' is quite substantial . ' names are a common cover-up . in the tattoo world it 's believed to be a jinx , if you put someone 's name on your body , it will end up bad . ' david designed a feminine paisley style tattoo to cover up the name and jess was delighted with the end result . she said : ' i love it , it looks amazing , jack is no more , you ca n't see the old tattoo at all . i feel like a weight is off my shoulders , it has a closed a chapter for me , now i can finally move on .
