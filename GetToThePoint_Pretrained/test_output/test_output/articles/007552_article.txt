this is the shocking moment a worker risked his life by standing on top of a house jet washing a roof with what appears to be just a rope tied around him for safety . the unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an edwardian semi-detached home in greenwich , south east london . a local resident noticed the man carrying out the work with a lack of safety equipment on the slippery tiles and quickly took snaps of the man . a worker who was caught jet washing the roof of a home in south east london with just a rope tied around him for safety . the neighbour said : ' i could n't believe it . he was standing on the roof with a power washer and seemed to have a rope tied around his waist . ' it looked incredibly dangerous . his boss seemed to be watching sitting on a wall opposite and seemed unfazed by it all . ' a building expert , who did not want to be named , said the workman should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a much longer ladder with a harness . he said : ' you ca n't just stand up there with a bit of rope tied around you and think it 's fine , it 's not . ' you have to think about how slippery it would be up there because as you can see he is spraying from the top to bottom , meaning the water will be trickling down around his feet . a building expert said the man should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a longer ladder . ' you would only have to slip and fall once and that would be it . ' the image was then passed to the health and safety executive , who attended the property and caught the man doing the same thing on the roof of the garage before he was stopped . a hse spokeswoman said : ' following a concern raised , hse inspectors visited the house yesterday and served a prohibition notice . ' this means the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures are put in place . '
