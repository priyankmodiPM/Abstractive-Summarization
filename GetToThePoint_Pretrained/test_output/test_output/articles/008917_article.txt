' kondogbia was incredible for monaco , he was exactly the player arsenal needed to sign , ' sportsmail 's jamie redknapp said back in february . the french midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the emirates stadium as the ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the champions league after a 3-1 first-leg win . but rather than arsenal , it now seems liverpool hold the main premier league interest in the 22-year-old . so , what more do you need to know ? monaco midfielder geoffrey kondogbia is a liverpool target and has also interested arsenal in recent years . 22 ? he 's been around for a while ... despite his young age , kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for lens , monaco , and even sevilla . and during that five-year professional career , the central midfielder has been constantly watched by arsenal scouts . he also impressed at the fifa under-20 world cup alongside paul pogba in the french midfield , while his frame and playing style does n't exactly scream 22 years old . kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with lens ( above ) , sevilla and monaco . the central midfielder was a key player for france alongside paul pogba at the under 20 world cup in 2013 . tough guy then ? exactly . standing at 6'2 '' , kondogbia is a real presence in the monaco midfield , allowing the likes of joao moutinho to strut their stuff further forward . he 's strong in the tackle , but make no mistake , his prowess on the ball is also impressive . possessing a fine left foot , kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker , and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against arsenal . having made his mark in both ligue 1 and la liga , you could say the frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder , someone who would fit in seamlessly in the premier league ... kondogbia 's fine strike put monaco in front against arsenal in the champions league last-16 first leg . so why have n't we seen him in england ? time is still on kondogbia 's side , but premier league clubs have certainly tried . arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left sevilla , though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for monaco . with liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine , the 22-year-old 's presence would surely suit brendan rodgers . but he must move quick , with real madrid , manchester united , juventus and paris st germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team . mesut ozil swapped shirts with kondogbia at half-time in the second leg at the stade louis ii .
