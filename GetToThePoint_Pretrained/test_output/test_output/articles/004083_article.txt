' evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment , as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody , ' her family wrote . ' however the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest , and she deserves that .

' ' her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body , ' they explained . ' she never demanded anything from anybody , but was always out giving her people . these near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle , and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals . ' these doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood . this emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion , ' they facebook post continued . her sister andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty . ' this was not the way to go home , no woman should risk death to improve on perfection , ' they said . ' tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself ' i am enough , i am worthy , i am perfect just the way i am ' .

' currently , the safest way to achieve the desired results through buttock augmentation is using silicone implants , ' an outline of the procedure which takes 2 and a half hours reads . ' although it might seem easy and economical , never allow anyone to inject substances that increase the volume of the buttocks through the injection of oily substances because the damage that they cause is irreversible due to the fact that the modelling agents can not be extracted from your body and will generate serious problems the rest of your life . ' the news comes after emotional tributes poured in for ms sarmonkias from friends and family . ' eva my heart , my love , my joy . where are you ? i need you . we were meant to grow old together and still be conquering life hand in hand as sisters . i 'm still not understanding . i have n't been able to sleep , ' sherri burton wrote . ms burton recalled the last time the pair spoke , and the final day they spent together before ms sarmonkias went overseas . ' the last thing you wrote to me , about 7 hours before you went to be with our heavenly father , was `` wish you were here with me '' . you always thought about me when you were having fun and wanted me to experience it . ' it has been 7 days since you were physically with me in this very room i’m typing in . sitting on this very chair , ' the tribute continued . 'eva… there are not enough words to express how i feel about you . thank you for loving me . i am honoured to have received such love . i am honoured to call you my sister . ms sarmonkias worked as a receptionist at lj hooker in surfer 's paradise , and her former colleagues have remembered her as bubbly , bright and beautiful young woman .
