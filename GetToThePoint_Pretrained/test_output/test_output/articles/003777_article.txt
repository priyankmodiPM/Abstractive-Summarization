' here 's what i believe - i think if you are applying for the job of prime minister , the very least the british people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview . ' what i 'm going to be doing is setting out the big choice facing our country , between a labour plan to have a recovery for working families across britain or more of the same from a government that believes that as long as you look after the rich and powerful everyone else will be okay .

' the programmes which have been agreed - including the bbc debate on the 16th - involved all sides , broadcasters and parties , making a number of compromises , allowing the different elements to go ahead . ' for each of the broadcasters , ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority , but an obligation and the bbc is satisfied that the election programmes it is offering on each of its services fulfils that obligation and that all the relevant parties will have the opportunity to put their case - and to be appropriately scrutinised .
