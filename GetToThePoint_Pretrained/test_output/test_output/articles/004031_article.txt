' ' i do n't speak english and the only place i 've been to in the u.s. is disneyworld , but i feel the heritage , ' said 77-year-old alcina tanner coltre , whose great-great-grandparents migrated from mississippi along with their 15-year-old son . ' my great-grandfather married a brazilian woman , so he integrated into brazilian culture pretty quickly , but it 's really important to me to come out every year to remember where we come from . ' the party takes place up a dusty dirt road flanked on both sides by sugarcane plantations , in a field that abuts on the ' cemiterio dos americanos , ' or ' american cemetery , ' which began as the resting place of the wife and two daughters of one of the first confederados and still serves their descendants today . amid food and beer stands bedecked with red-white-and-blue ribbons , extended families tucked into diet-busting barbecue and hamburger lunches as ' dixie ' played on a loop . teenage girls pulled hoop skirts over their cut-off short-shorts and wiggled into bustier tops , taking to the stage painted with a giant confederate flag on the arms of young men in grey and yellow johnny reb uniforms . the pairs solemnly presented the flags of the 13 confederate states and square danced to raucous fiddle music . but for the abundance of glitter eye shadow and the modern tattoos peeking out from beneath the uniforms , the stage had a convincing ' gone with the wind ' vibe . american visitors rex and gwen gray , civil war buffs who made the trip to brazil from their home in tucumcari , new mexico , were sold .

' they were seen as desirable , educated colonists , ' said clabough , adding the confederados introduced the bull-tongue plow and other agricultural innovations to brazil . ' and from the point of view of american southerners who had just gone through this catastrophic conflict and were looking toward an uncertain reconstruction period , it certainly seemed attractive . ' the fact that slavery was still legal in brazil , where it was outlawed only in 1888 , may also have been a factor , though clabough said it was doubtful many of the confederados would have been able to afford slaves either in the u.s. or in brazil . legend has it that dom pedro himself was on hand at rio 's port to greet the first batch of confederados , mostly enlisted men and small family farmers who were then dispatched to rural areas of the surrounding states . difficult conditions in brazil swiftly took their toll . many succumbed to tropical diseases , while others were felled by sheer exhaustion . about half gave up and returned to the u.s. , said clabough . those who stayed ended up assimilating into brazilian society , and very few of the confederados ' descendants speak english today . some are racially mixed â€” as is common in this majority black and multiracial nation . mixed-race guests at sunday 's party seemed unruffled by the omnipresent confederate flag .
