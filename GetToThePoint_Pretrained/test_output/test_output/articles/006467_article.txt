no tiger woods and no rory mcilroy in the field is proving no problem in houston , where record numbers have descended on the small suburb of humble for the shell houston open . the last tournament before the masters is proving quite a show-stopper itself thanks to the crowd-pleasing antics of the popular phil mickelson and local boy jordan spieth . it’s 18 months now since spieth attracted criticism for giving up on university and joining the pga tour as the 809th ranked player in the world . spieth , only 21 , has since risen to number four in the world . funnily enough , no-one’s criticising him anymore . spectators have flocked to see texas local boy jordan spieth in action at the shell houston open . spieth 's fellow american phil mickelson has also impressed in the run up to the masters . in seven starts this season spieth , who finished runner-up on his masters debut last year , has finished outside the top seven only twice , and here a second-round 66 lifted him to within three shots of the leader , andrew putnam . as for mickelson , he’d hardly played a decent shot this year before posting rounds of 66 and 67 to be one stroke behind at halfway . the stage was set beautifully , therefore , for the two americans at opposite ends of their careers . englishmen justin rose and paul casey were also going well at five shots off the pace .
