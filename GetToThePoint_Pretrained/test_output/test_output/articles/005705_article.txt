' at the peak of the show 's popularity , some 28 million people tuned in . sir hugh continued : ' harold wilson that evening began by accusing the bbc of plotting against him . i told him that he must really know in his heart of hearts that that was untrue , and unless he withdrew that remark there was no point in our discussing anything . we could just have a drink and that could be that . ' he did withdraw and we talked about the steptoe and son problem . the next day i discussed the matter further with the controller of bbc one and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock , when at that time the polls closed . ' i rang up harold wilson and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him . ' he won , i think , by four , and i 've sometimes wondered what effect my decision had on british political history . ' former bbc director general sir hugh greene , pictured , said mr wilson feared broadcasting steptoe and son on the 1964 election night could end up costing the labour party 20 seats - they won the election by four . mr wilson also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive . he said : ' polling then ended at nine o'clock and a lot of our people - my people , working in liverpool , long journey out , perhaps then a high tea and so on , it was getting late , especially if they wanted to have a pint first . ' i said i did n't want a popular programme between eight to nine o'clock . it was the equivalent of bringing morecambe and wise back . hugh did n't think much of this argument . he said : `` what would you prefer to put on between eight o'clock and nine o'clock ? `` ' i said : `` greek drama , preferably in the original .
