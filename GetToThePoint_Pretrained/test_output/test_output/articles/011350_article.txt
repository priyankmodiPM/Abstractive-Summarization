' one of my favourites is the gardener at hougoumont . he and his family meant to escape before the battle but left it too late . he is portrayed on the model protecting his cabbages . many french attackers saw him during the battle and laughed at his actions . ' the 200th anniversary of waterloo is a landmark commemoration of a decisive victory that brought peace to europe after years of conflict . ' whilst thousands will be making the trip to belgium to participate in and witness re-enactments on the battlefield , we can bring the battlefield to britain . ' late arrival : von blucher leading the prussian troops onto the battlefield , in a decisive intervention . repair : the diorama was in a poor condition before being restored ahead of the anniversary . spruced up : these images show how the figures were covered in dust before their recent restoration . conservation : kelvin and mary thatcher used a vacuum cleaner to help remove the grime which had built up . conservationists kelvin and mary thatcher spent five months cleaning the figures on the diorama , and glued back together scores of severed limbs , lost swords and displaced cannonballs . mr hayes added : ' the diorama was made in the 1970s by valhalla models and acquired by the museum in the 1980s . but it never had a top put on it so has got extremely dusty over the years . ' kelvin and mary thatcher took it apart in 16 sections and took four sections at a time back to their home in norfolk where they cleaned each individual figure using an air hose and a vacuum cleaner . ' they have done a fantastic job and it is great to be able to see the incredible detail so clearly . ' the battle of waterloo on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of napoleon across europe and sent the great french emperor into exile for a second and final time . france 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the british army under the command of the duke of wellington . the armies amassed near the town of waterloo in modern-day belgium , not far from the border with france , and it was the french who made the first move around 11am . the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the british fending off repeated attacks from the french , until marshal bl√ºcher arrived at the head of a prussian army . this was the decisive intervention which finished napoleon off , allowing wellington to counter-attack and forcing the frenchman to surrender . the battle forced napoleon from the throne of france , leading to his exile on st helena - but wellington later admitted it was ' the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life ' . despite the popular image of waterloo as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the french bearing the brunt of the losses .
