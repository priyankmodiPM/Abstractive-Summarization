' if he comes , welcome . but i do n't want to get into that story , ' where is he going ? ' ' the only thing i know is that he told me he 's not coming to chelsea , for sure - and he told me that personally , so , i 'm calm . ' stoke boss mark hughes forecast that klopp 's pedigree in european competition would work in his favour for clubs looking to compete on the biggest stage . he said : ' a lot of foreign coaches want to come to the premier league - it is very attractive to them . he is a big character and personality it seems . ' i do n't know the guy personally as i have n't met him , but he has had a good record apart from this year , where he has had a real struggle . ' maybe that suggests the way he works works for a certain period . but he has had to obviously handle the loss of key players in his time , because that is what happens in germany invariably - bayern munich come and take your better players , strengthening themselves and weakening you as an opponent - so he has had to manage through that . blues veteran didier drogba ( right ) takes on andreas christensen during training . cesc fabregas continues to wear his protective mask ahead of the visit of manchester united . new signing juan cuadrado shields the ball from brazilian defender filipe luis . gary cahill leaves john obi mikel trailing in his wake as the blues head towards the league title .

' i 'm not surprised if there is a lot of interest around him , if that is what he said , but he has not had quite as good a season [ at dortmund ] as a couple of seasons ago , so perhaps that is why he is jumping ship and going somewhere else , as he sees he can not go any further where he is , where he has done a fantastic job . ' sam allardyce has complained the the arrival of foreign coaches limits homegrown opportunities . arsenal defender per mertesacker has backed klopp to be a success in the premier league . meanwhile , klopp 's compatriot and arsenal defender per mertesacker admitted surprise at his decision to leave dortmund , but backed him to be a success in england . mertesacker said : ' i 've got some nice experiences in the premier league and of course it would be nice if a german coach would take the challenge of working in the premier league .

' everyone has their philosophy and i think jurgen klopp has proved that he 's top-level and can teach a lot . '
