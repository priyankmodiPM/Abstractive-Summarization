a young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry . kyli wilfson , a self-confessed ‘ food person’ , was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘ kicked in the abdomen ' – whenever she ate , a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘ resolve itself’ in a matter of days . kyli , now 29 , was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , and the north carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube , as the disease , which effects less than .01 per cent of people , would only get worse . within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs , she revealed to cosmopolitan.com , and had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals . mystery illness : kyli wolfson , pictured , had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in october 2012 ; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half . at first , doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing kyli ; though she 'd had digestive problems for years , her rare disease was n't initially considered . instead , doctors at her local er insisted that she had acute pancreatitis , a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers . however , kyli 's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure . ' it never even changed , ' she said , explaining that when she tried to eat , it felt like she was burning on the inside . ' it was still ten-out-of-ten pain . ' three months after her first visit to the emergency room , she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted . literally starving : still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain , kyli was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé dustin wood to feel bad eating in front of her . rapid weight loss : kyli's weight , which is normally at around 110lbs , dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest . sufferers of the illness , which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas , have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves , and eventually leads to permanent damage . kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely , which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé dustin wood . ' we 're food people , ' she said . ' we [ love ] to bake , order takeout . now he felt bad eating in front of me . ' luckily , kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on facebook , some of whom said they found a way to eat : a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas , spleen , gallbladder , appendix , and duodenum , which allows the pancreas ' cells to be transplanted into the liver , enabling it to function as a pancreas . so kyli flew to a hospital in minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery , and scheduled her procedure for january 2014 . enduring love : kyli 's wedding to fiancé dustin is back on , now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain . after her surgery , kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again . ' i was excited , but nervous , since it had been so long since i 'd eaten , ' she said . ' sure enough , i had chicken broth and juice and it did n't affect anything . it was amazing . ' she soon began enjoying ice cream , lobster , and pizza , and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs . ' the number one thing that helped was the support group i joined and knowing other people going through it , ' she said . ' they saved me and gave me hope . ' now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery , kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to dustin . she will walk down the aisle in october .
