' like you say , i 've played with a lot of champions , but he is the best ; and he ' s proven it by performing for enormous clubs such as barcelona and arsenal . ' it ' s quite easy to be a star in a little or medium team , where there is no pressure and where competition is far to be ferocious . ' but to confirm your individual qualities within the biggest teams is something only few can achieve . ' asked to compare sanchez and neymar , di natale added : ' if i had to choose one , i 'd choose alexis : because he 's a little more concrete .

' i was amazed by his technical skills : he did things with the ball that were more typical of a juggler than a footballer . but what really impressed me was the approach he had to the everyday work . ' in my career , i 've seen a lot of talented players squandering their abilities with the wrong attitude , with a sort of indolence . alexis was the contrary . ' i 've never seen him distracted , he was always attentive and focused , he was always ready to work harder in order to improve , to add some new trick to his natural talent . ' this is probably his secret , and the thing that has allowed him to become one of the greatest players around today : he combines individual quality with a willingness for collective sacrifice . '
