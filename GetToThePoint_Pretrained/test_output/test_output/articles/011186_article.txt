' all three defendants were sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for two years , ordered to carry out unpaid work and pay £250 each towards prosecution costs . judge michael grieve qc added : ‘it’s not easy to establish your roles in these offences . ‘ one is left to wonder how there could ever have been a realistic prospect of mrs pacskowska , who is polish and speaks little if any english , passing herself off as georgina bagnall-oakeley to the satisfaction of a qualified solicitor . the £1million house in clarendon mews , bayswater , which the group had tried to sell from under owner georgina bagnall-oakley 's nose . ‘ ms brzezinska i can only conclude that your role was to support and interpret for your mother-in-law . ‘it’s absolutely clear that there were others who lay behind this fraud who would have substantially benefitted from it and who used you to open yourselves up to high risk for relatively little reward . ‘ you took part willingly and for financial gain and provided photographs to be used on false driving licences and passports . ‘ others played leading roles in this fraud which on one view was a very sophisticated property fraud . ‘ but your mission was doomed to failure . the victim said she was left feeling ‘ vulnerable , apprehensive and anxious’ after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity to sell her home , pictured . ‘ there was an anonymous tip-off to the solicitors who alerted the police and officers then lay in wait for you in november . ’ he added : ‘ the value of the sale and intended loss to the victim , a 76-year-old lady , is put at just short of £1million . ‘ an elderly lady stood to lose almost £1million through the theft of her property . ‘ she speaks of the vulnerability that the theft of another person’s identity can cause . ’
