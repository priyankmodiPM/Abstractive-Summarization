' we do n't want to be imprisoned by the past , ' obama said thursday during the first leg of his trip abroad in in jamaica .

' a u.s. official said kerry and rodriguez used their meeting to smooth the way for cuba 's removal from the list . the united states has pushed for cuban assurances of no future support for terrorism , and cuba has made the same demand of washington . striking cuba from the list would move the two countries closer to renewing full diplomatic relations , broken off by washington in 1961 , and would be popular in latin america , where governments had pushed washington for years to change its cuba policy . panama 's president juan carlos varelam center right , obama smile at the signing of an agreement for the panamanian airline copa to buy total of 61 boeing aircraft . also pictured is copa airlines president , stanley motta ( back ) , and ceo of copa airlines , pedro heilbron , right . widespread praise in the region for obama 's new cuba policy was tempered last month , however , when his administration imposed sanctions on venezuela , cuba 's closest ally and main benefactor . that controversy now hangs over the summit , which ends on saturday . venezuelan president nicolas maduro says he will present obama with a petition signed by 13.4 million people demanding that the sanctions be reversed . he is certain to receive support from castro and other left-wing leaders in latin america . of the situation , rhodes on friday said , ' our principal way of communicating with venezuela will be direct dialogue , even as we know that there will be differences between our two governments on a variety of issues . ' following friday 's announcement that president obama would in fact meet with castro , south carolina senator lindsey graham , increasingly a thorn in the administration 's side , said the u.s. president ' is truly writing new chapters in american foreign policy ' - but they are ' ones of america and the values we stand for – human rights , freedom , and democracy – in retreat and decline . ' graham accused obama of appeasing ' autocratic dictators , thugs , and adversaries and said he has ' emboldened ' america 's enemies while leaving the country 's ' friends demoralized .
