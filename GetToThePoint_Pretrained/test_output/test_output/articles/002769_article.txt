the tesla model s p85d 's ' insane mode ' may be fast , but a new electric car by drive eo is set to be even faster . the latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in the pikes peak international hill climb in june . the stomach-churning vehicle , dubbed eo pp03 , runs on 50 kwh lithium-ion battery pack driving six yasa-400 electric motors . latvia-based drive eo has created a vehicle , named eo pp03 , which runs on 50 kwh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six yasa-400 electric motors and produces 1020 kw ( 1368 horsepower ) . it is capable of producing 1020 kw ( 1368 horsepower ) and speeds of up to 160 mph ( 260 km/h ) , compared to the top speed of 155 mph ( 249 km/h ) on the model s . drive eo says it will be the ' first one megawatt all-electric race car with peak torque of 2160 nm and kerb weight is targeted at 2646lb ( 1,200kg ) . the car is still in development and the company has yet to reveal its range . ' we want to become the first overall winner with an electric vehicle , ' said kristaps dambis , project director at drive eo . drive eo was the first to enter and complete the dakar rally with a hybrid electric vehicle . that was followed by the creation of eo pp01 , a purpose built fully electric prototype race car to participate at the pikes peak international hill climb competition . the one megawatt electric race car is set to compete in the pikes peak international hill climb ( pictured ) in colorado springs . the race is the second oldest motor racing event in the us and runs on a challenging 12.42 mile ( 20km ) course with 156 turns in colorado springs . all wheel drive . six yasa-400 electric motors with eo controllers . peak power 1020 kw / peak torque 2160 nm . 50 kwh lithium-ion battery pack with bms . steel tubular spaceframe with carbon fibre body . electrically assisted power steering . 4-way adjustable shock absorbers . 320/710 r18 slick tyres / 13 ' Ã— 18 ' wheels . kerb weight : 2646lb ( 1,200kg ) top speed:155 mph ( 249 km/h ) the race is the second oldest motor racing event in the us and runs on a challenging 12.42 mile ( 20km ) course with 156 turns in colorado springs . it begins at 2,862 metre elevation ( 9,390 feet ) and finishes at the 4,301 metre ( 14,110 feet ) summit of the pikes peak mountain in colorado springs . the announcement of the drive eo pp03 following the development of software upgrades to make the p85d even faster . ' tesla p85d 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm , ' tesla founder elon musk tweeted earlier this year . musk was referring to something known as the ' insane mode ' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds . the d model , unveiled in october has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels . it has a top speed of 155 mph ( 249 km/h ) , compared with the current 130 mph ( 209 km/h ) on tesla 's previous s model . in insane mode , the full 691 horsepower of the electric car 's two motors is applied in one go . at the launch event , mr musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill . during recent tests of the insane acceleration , also carried out by dragtimes , the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds .
