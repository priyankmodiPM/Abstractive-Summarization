' arsenal need to buy four players , they need that spine , ' the frenchman told sky sports .

's iker casillas , the promise of mainz 's loris karius but mattia perin at genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists . he is 22 and tipped to become the new gianluigi buffon but arsenal have watched him for three years now . liverpool have also considered him as have inter milan . another option with premier league experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is asmir begovic

aleksandar dragovic but the austrian is a target for inter milan . aymen abdennour . monaco . cost : £10million . the 25-year-old tunisia international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join arsenal who have had scouts posted at most monaco games throughout the season . they are well aware of abdennour , who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his

will strengthen arsenal 's hand if they choose to step up interest . much depends how francis coquelin performs between now and the end of the season but kondogbia is a player of great potential .

games , breaking club records , but has struggled against the top sides . still only 23 , lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man . fits arsenal 's style and life with
