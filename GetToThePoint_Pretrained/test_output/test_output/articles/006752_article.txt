the glowing blue letters that once lit the bronx from above yankee stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at sotheby 's on wednesday . while the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 , the only person who raised a paddle - for $ 260,000 - was a sotheby 's employee trying to jump start the bidding . the current owner of the signage is yankee hall of famer reggie jackson , who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008 . no love : 13 letters that hung over yankee stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 , but received no bids at a sotheby 's auction wednesday . the 68-year-old yankee said he wanted ' a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the yankees and of new york city . ' the letters had beamed from atop yankee stadium near grand concourse in the bronx since 1976 , the year before jackson joined the team . espn reports jackson , who attended the auction , bought the letters ' on a lark . ' jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters , some of which are also 10-feet-wide , he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself . he promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the united states , he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner 's home . yankee stadium : the letters at the stadium , which was built in 1923 , were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . in addition to the letters , sotheby 's was auctioning off a new york mets bullpen car from the late 60s . despite the mets memorabilia being estimated at only $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , it raked in a winning bid of $ 112,500 at auction .
