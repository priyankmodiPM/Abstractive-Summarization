' today has been a big eye opener , ' williams said afterwards . ' i 'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as i thought i was . now i 'm in the mindset of , `` you know what , i 'm not on hard court . '' i 'm playing like i 'm on hard court and i 'm not . ' so i have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary . ' williams , 33 , won her 19th singles grand slam at the australian open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year . the french open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in paris in 2002 and 2013 . her doubles defeat on sunday blotted an otherwise flawless fed cup record and left the us facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year . ' we have to work harder , ' us captain mary joe fernandez said . ' we came close today and need to just keep plugging away . ' the good news is that we have a lot of players in the top 100 and , hopefully , we can get two wins next year and get back into the world group . ' williams congratulates italy captain corrado barazzutti after competing in america 's doubles defeat .
