midfielder cheikhou kouyate has warned west ham must be ready to face a ' wounded animal ' at manchester city on sunday , but will be ready to inflict more pain on manuel pellegrini 's men . the barclays premier league champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches , thrashed 4-2 at rivals united last weekend - a result which left the long-term future of manager pellegrini in doubt as city might now face a scrap with liverpool for a champions league qualifying spot . west ham are also in need a pick-me-up , having seen victory slip through their fingers when stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at upton park . west ham midfielder cheikhou kouyate is wary of facing champions manchester city on sunday . city midfielder yaya toure ( centre ) and his team-mates suffered a 4-2 defeat at old trafford last week . senegal midfielder kouyate expects city to produce a response , but also one from sam allardyce 's squad , who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the european places . ' anything is possible in football , but we must n't forget who we are up against . they are a wounded animal , because they need points , so they have to wake themselves up to win , ' kouyate said on the club 's official website , www.whufc.com . ' we need the points as well , because we want to remain in the top 10 . ' it is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year 's champions of england . ' if we are going to get anything there , we have to enjoy it and really play as a team and work as a team . ' kouyate celebrates with left back aaron cresswell after his goal against stoke at upton park last saturday . marouane fellaini ( right ) scores united 's second goal as city fell to another premier league defeat . kouyate added : ' a team like manchester city ca n't afford to make mistakes , so for us it 's a good time to face them , but we must n't underestimate them , there 's life in them yet . ' west ham look short of options in attack . striker enner valencia is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against stoke , while diafra sakho , who has netted 12 goals in all competitions , is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain . allardyce is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses . he said : ' that leaves us very short on the front line with andy ( carroll ) being out , and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be , so if we do n't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us .
