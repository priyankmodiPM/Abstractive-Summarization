' throughout the communications , it is clear that they were discussing a plan to attack an anzac parade in melbourne , australia . ' miss ledwidge said the options discussed were to carry out ' a knife attack on police , or a `` car op '' on police , or a gun attack on police ' . the second allegation , miss ledwidge said , related to a plan to ' break into someone 's house and behead someone ' in australia . chilling : the alleged plot to carry out an attack during the ceremony ( pictured ) honouring fallen soldiers from the first world war involved running over a policeman and hacking him to death . never forget : anzac day memorials mark one hundred days since australia and new zealand 's soldiers arrived in turkey , where ceremonies are also being held ( pictured ) . mr besim ( left ) was one of two men arrested by australian police for allegedly planning the ' isis inspired ' attack and both were ' associates ' of abdul numan haider ( right ) who stabbed two officers outside a melbourne police station in september . the boy was said to have ' suggested he [ besim ] should pick someone who was a loner and would n't be noticed ' . defence lawyer david king agreed the case should be sent to the crown court , as the allegations constitute ' grave crimes ' under existing legislation . mr king said the boy was from a ' respectable family ' and that his father had conscientiously sat through a total of 40 interviews between his son and investigators .

' the first allegation is that , between 15 and 26 march 2015 , the defendant incited another person to commit an act of terrorism . ' namely to carry out an attack at an anzac parade in australia with the aim of killing and / or causing serious injury to people . ' the second allegation is that on 18 march 2015 , the defendant incited another person to behead someone in australia . ' ' we have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest . ' the alleged plot bears a frightening resemblance to that of hate preachers michael adebolajo and michael adebowale who butchered british soldier lee rigby in south-east london in may 2013 . anzac day was established to mark the anniversary of the start of the first world war gallipoli campaign and ceremonies are held on april 25 each year in memory of australian and new zealand soldiers who have died in battle . this yearâ€™s events , being held tomorrow , take on extra significance as the centenary of the conflict in turkey is marked . attack : australian federal police acting deputy commissioner neil gaughan ( left ) confirmed that two 18-year-old men had planned to target anzac day activities . two teenagers were also among those arrested by counter-terrorism police in australia on suspicion of planning and carrying out the anzac day attack . victoria police deputy commissioner said both men were ' associates ' of abdul numan haider , the 18-year-old shot dead after stabbing two officers outside a melbourne police station in september . a number of ' edged weapons ' including knives and swords were seized at some of the properties searched . a total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the melbourne joint counter terrorism team operation named operation rising in which 200 officers raided seven properties . all five were on the radar of counter-terrorism investigators , according to australian federal police acting commissioner michael phelan . he said : ' particularly since late last month the investigation ramped up and it became very obvious to us that their plans were specific . ' we received information earlier this week that led us to undertake the resolution today . ' copycat : the attack he was allegedly planning bears a frightening resemblance to the death of british soldier lee rigby ( pictured ) who was tragically stabbed to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of london in 2013 . killers : michael adebolajo ( right ) and michael adebowale ( left ) ran down 25-year-old lee rigby in woolwich before ' butchering him ' to death . london is hosting three anzac ceremonies on saturday : a service at hyde park corner , another at westminster abbey and a wreath-laying ceremony at the cenotaph on whitehall . the queen and the duke of edinburgh are due to attend the services at the cenotaph and westminster abbey . the duke of cambridge will join them at the cenotaph and princess anne will attend the dawn service at hyde park corner . security will be extremely high at all three events - with those attending told to carry photographic id - and it could be ramped up further after recent terror arrests . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .
