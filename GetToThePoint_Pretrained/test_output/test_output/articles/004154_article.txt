' it 's more than anything else what 's driving the success of their company . ' market researchers , however , expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year , particularly at the higher price range where apple competes , as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one . that could make it difficult for apple to maintain its recent pace . ' they 're extremely dependent on the iphone , ' said investment colin gillis at bgc partners .
