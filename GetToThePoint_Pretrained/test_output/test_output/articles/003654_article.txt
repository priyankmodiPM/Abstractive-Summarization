if there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it 's the hassle of peeling it . more often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers , on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food . but one canny youtube user , micahmedia , has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water . scroll down for video . the hard-boiled egg is placed in a glass ( left ) before it is filled quarter of the way with tap water ( right ) . he pops the hardboiled egg into a small tumbler glass before filling it a quarter of the way with water . he then places his hand over the top of the glass , completely covering it . his next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right . he keeps the glass in the sink so that the water doesn’t spill . after approximately ten seconds of shaking , the youtuber lifts his hand to show the egg , which now has a cracked shell . he simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds , lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg . the 28-second video which was uploaded in january this year currently has over 16million views on the video-sharing website . the egg is vigorously shaken from left to right so that the shell loosens . result ! once the water has splashed out of the glass , simply peel lift the shell from the egg with no hassle . youtube users have been praising micahmedia for his ingenious solution to the age-old problem . ‘ well this has changed my morning . good job , thanks , ’ wrote nikki madison . susan wheeler wrote : ‘ i have tried just about every method i have come across and been disappointed on the most part . this actually works wonderfully . i love doing it . thanks ! ’ micahmedia posted that he’s thinking of ‘ doing six boiled eggs at once and seeing what happens . ’
