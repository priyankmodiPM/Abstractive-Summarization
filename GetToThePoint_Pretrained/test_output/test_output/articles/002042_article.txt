' obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier u.s. travel to cuba , more remittances to the island and , at least on paper , u.s. exports to support the island 's relatively new private business sector . obama also moved to remove cuba from the u.s. list of state sponsors of terror , removing a barrier to access to the global financial system . cuban officials have been pushing obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for u.s. businesses to trade with cuba in ways currently prohibited . ' the president of the united states has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue , ' cuomo said . ten previous u.s. governors have visited cuba since 1999 but none since 2010 , according to the u.s.-cuba trade and economic council .
