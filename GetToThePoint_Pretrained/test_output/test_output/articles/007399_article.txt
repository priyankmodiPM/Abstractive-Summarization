'it’s made such a difference , ' she says . ' you don’t get much time to cook , so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer , which we 'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out . ' with the catering , we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch . that made keeping our figures loads easier .

'' ' another said , `` your face is huge , '' because when i do pile on the pounds it always shows up really quickly on my face in the shape of a double chin . ' there were also lots of comments about being be the `` fat one '' in the show and the `` fat lass '' .
