' davion officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers . after 16 years davion was finally home . what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when davion stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well . ' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december .
