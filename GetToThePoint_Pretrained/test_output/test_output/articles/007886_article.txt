' i had him drop me off a block away from the bar because i did n't want to be in the car anymore . i felt very unsafe , ' she told the gothamist . shock : ms hessel was horrified when uber billed her for $ 16,000 - with a $ 4,000 refund . her total statement was $ 12,251.49 . uber says the eye-popping figure was a clerical error and that the customer was never actually charged the outrageous sum . but the nightmare trip was far from over . after receiving her initial bill of $ 56.40 , the passenger immediate e-mailed uber support to complain she had been overcharged and that the driver had unnecessarily extended the ride . within a few days , the uber resp had written back to inform ms hessel the company agreed the journey was ' inefficient ' and she would get a refund of $ 15 . but the following morning , she received a bizarre email which stated she owed uber more than $ 16,000 - with a refund of $ 4,000 . her total , in the end , came to $ 12,251.49 . ' it freaked me out , ' she told dna info . ' i have bad eye sight and i thought maybe i was n't reading it correctly .

' the company has since pledged to refund the entire cost of her ride . a spokesman said : ' we apologize to this rider for any inconvenience and we have provided them with a full refund . '
