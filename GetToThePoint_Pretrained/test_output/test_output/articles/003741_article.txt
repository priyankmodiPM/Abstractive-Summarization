' the obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction , ' he told cnn . ' we think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent , which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the army . it 's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now . ' of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014 , only 72,000 qualified . some did n't make the cut because they had a criminal background , too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent did n't qualify because they were overweight . according to the cdc , 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight . army recruiters , facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up , have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on nbc 's the biggest loser . boot camp : the maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females . the recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp . many still fail to make the grade , but some do - such as a female recruit from kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up .
