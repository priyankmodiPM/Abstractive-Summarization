' come on , guys , ' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he 'd missed out on pole . hamilton was relaxed . vettel was downcast , but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying . hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap . it was enough . rosberg , though , got closer to hamilton than he has recently , perhaps heeding the advice of niki lauda , his team chairman , who told him via sportsmail to ‘ sort himself out’ . mclaren will be towards the back of the grid . jenson button will start 17th and fernando alonso 18th . barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions . a naturally disappointed button said : ' the car did n't feel bad so it 's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there . we 've made good improvements this weekend , but qualifying just was n't for us . ' hopefully we 'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow , but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well . ' sebastian vettel qualified third but could threaten hamilton 's supremacy with the ferrari stronger than mercedes over a long run . rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row , but the german was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position . hamilton 's impressive lap on his first run on q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the chinese grand prix . vettel starts ahead of williams pair felipe massa and valtteri bottas , with ferrari team-mate kimi raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in q3 , with his best lap in q2 . red bull 's daniel ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the lotus of romain grosjean , with sauber pair felipe nasr and marcus ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th . pastor maldonado lines up 11th , missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second , with daniil kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his red bull . jenson button out-qualified fernando alonso for the second consecutive race , but will only start 17th for mclaren . fernando alonso starts 18th in shanghai and will have the manor cars of will stevens and roberto merhi for company at the back of the grid . toro rosso rookies max verstappen and carlos sainz jr start 13th and 14th , with sergio perez 15th in a force india that is off the pace as the team 's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until june . from the initial 18-minute session , force india 's nico hulkenberg led the list of departees , finishing three tenths of a second behind team -mate perez . for the first time this season manor had both cars taking part in qualifying , with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule . will stevens , forced to sit out qualifying and the races in australia and malaysia due to issues , finally enjoyed a one-lap session . the 23-year-old briton will start 19th , eight tenths of a second ahead of roberto merhi , albeit three seconds behind alonso , underlining that whilst manor are fighting , they still have a lot of work to do .
