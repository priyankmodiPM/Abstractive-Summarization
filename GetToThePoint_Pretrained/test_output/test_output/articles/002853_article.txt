is generally expensive , this is a more normal-tasting version and britain’s costliest home-grown honey . most manuka plants grow in new zealand but bushes have been growing , hidden behind a garden wall , on the tregothnan estate in cornwall since 1880 . bees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art , six-foot hives , which cost £5,000 each . there is only a limited supply made , hence the hefty price tag . verdict : this honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars , so every teaspoon is expensive . yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans . the jar opens to reveal a light , cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust . dip your spoon in to discover solid , set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar . i used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it . a treat for anyone with a sweet tooth . 4/5 . tregothnan cornish floral manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars , so every spoonful is pricey . vasilissa greek honey with edible gold leaf . £39.99 for 250g , selfridges.co.uk . promise : produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of evia , this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling . the small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom , infusing it with the flavour of the herb . greek honey is said to be among the best in the world , thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers , long sunny days and ancient , organic production methods . verdict : the shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover . it looks so good , i don’t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight . the beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special , and when i unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume . inside is a smooth , dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle . the experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year ; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage . tasting this , i can see why they call honey the food of the gods . 5/5 . vasilissa greek honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling . alemany rosemary honey . £7.95 for 500g , souschef.co.uk . promise : this is made by a small producer in northern spain , still using the same traditional methods after five generations . the nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the montsec mountains , and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content . it is said to be particularly good for the digestion , and as an aid to relaxation . verdict : this is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg . dip your spoon in for oozing , runny honey in the middle , but enjoy the crunch of the pale , crystallised honey at the sides . it’s very mild — there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls . it does gives a rather surprising aftertaste , though . this is my daughter ruby’s favourite honey — she describes it as the best of both worlds , for its double consistency . 4/5 . alemany rosemary honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the montsec mountains . welsh chunk honeycomb amphora . £21 for 908g ,

. verdict : this looks impressive — a huge glass jar with golden , syrupy honey and a huge , striking honeycomb in the middle , sparkling like a jewel . the fortnum & mason label adds to the impression of real quality . what a disappointment , then , to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax . the chewy mass is like old gum . i spit it out — as does my honey-loving son charlie , who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy . proof that paying more doesn’t always guarantee a pot of gold . 1/5 . heather honeycomb starflower honey . £19.99 for 227g , selfridges.co.uk . promise : the starflower is another name for the borage plant ( which sounds much less exotic ) . but this herbal flower is rich in calcium , vitamin c and potassium . it is used to strengthen adrenal functions , and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases . this light and delicate honey comes from hampshire , and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour . verdict : you can’t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid , because the pale honey that surrounds it isn’t transparent . i’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself , but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again . it crumbles delightfully in the mouth , while the light honey ( not quite runny but not totally set ) unleashes a real taste of the countryside . the jar , with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label , gives this a real sense of occasion . 4/5 . heather honeycomb starflower honey crumbles delightfully in the mouth , while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside . chestnut honey . £6.95 for 500g , souschef.co.uk . promise : a dark , runny honey with a rich , nutty taste and smoky aromas . this is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree , so it has a slightly bitter , savoury aftertaste . a favourite among chefs , who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes . verdict : after tasting so many sweet honeys , this one came as a total shock . a dark brown , treacle-tasting honey , it has a wonderful , unmistakable chestnut aroma . my children didn’t like it at all , but i teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner . perfect if you want something completely different . 3/5 . chestnut honey is a dark , runny honey with a rich , nutty taste and smoky aromas .
