' next season they 'll be better , they 'll be more experienced , they 'll be more able to cope than they have been this season . ' among the new arrivals on saturday was former ipswich town left back cresswell , who scored with a brilliant free-kick before marko arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser . west ham had dominated early on and cresswell’s curling effort left goalkeeper asmir begovic flummoxed to open the scoring . west ham had dominated early on and aaron cresswell’s curling effort from a free-kick gave them the lead . diafra sakho is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season , and he limped off . but stoke grew into the game as the home side waned and arnautovic had two goals ruled out for offside either side of mame biram diouf hitting the inside of the post with a header . the fired-up austrian wasn’t to be denied though and he eventually shot across adrian’s goal and into the corner with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end . it was a familiar scene for the home support whose reaction at the final whistle indicated that they do not see allardyce as the man in charge as this inexperienced side grows . super stat : west ham have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season ( seven ) than any other premier league team . carl jenkinson might have come from arsenal but he was never a first-choice option with the gunners .
