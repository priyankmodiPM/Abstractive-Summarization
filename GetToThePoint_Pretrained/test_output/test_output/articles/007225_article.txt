' ayew , who is represented in england by agent mark mckay of excelfoot , added : ' i grew up watching english football and i support liverpool . steven gerrard is my favourite player . they have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players . ayew 's favourite player growing up was steven gerrard , who will leave liverpool at the end of the season . a player he knew from their time together at marseille , ayew speaks regularly to joey barton ( right ) . ' i 'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career . i have offers from england , italy and germany but it would be unfair to say who from . i speak to my friends such as morgan amalfitano at west ham and joey barton at qpr and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere . ' i have been fortunate to experience stamford bridge and old trafford in the champions league but i want to play at anfield and other grounds . ' i know my quality . i have shown i can play at marseille and i have taken on responsibility with my country . it 's important that you always strive to be better . you see with players such as eden hazard how hard they work and i believe in hard work to get better . it 's easy to talk though , what is important is that i do it . ' the ghana international is also being looked at by swansea , newcastle and everton in the premier league . liverpool have already secured the signing of divock origi ( left ) , who will move to anfield in the summer . ayew 's ideal is to help marseille win the french league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders paris saint-germain by five points . ' i will fight to the end for marseille then i will make my decision . it is an important step for me . ' liverpool already have divock origi in the bag and are keen on burnley 's danny ings but will be enthused that a player of ayew 's pedigree has such desire to play for them . failure to reach the champions league could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer . brendan rodgers wants a goalkeeper , midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward . he likes memphis depay at psv eindhoven but the holland international is expected to join manchester united .
