' we are experimenting with a few things , but i think for now we have to go back to what we know , get our basics right , ' said ricciardo . ' we have done quite a bit . in malaysia we had brake issues , a lot of overheating , so we have reverted back on a few things , even from last year which we knew was more efficient . ' just because it 's from last year it does n't mean it 's not better , so i guess we have taken a step back in that direction . the team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid . ' ricciardo has no doubt renault are also pulling their weight , adding : ' from melbourne to malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability . ' we also have a few more software things this weekend , which should give things another pretty significant step on that side . ' i appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front , so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five . ' daniil kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of fp2 after his brakes caught fire . team-mate daniil kvyat , however , was not so fortunate as the young russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of fp2 after his brakes caught fire . christian horner said : ' something overheated within the rear hub assembly . as a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap . ' we asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible , but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off . ' it 's frustrating it 's happened , but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was . ' despite suffering brake issues in malaysia , horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by kvyat are ' totally unrelated ' . horner added : ' today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow .
