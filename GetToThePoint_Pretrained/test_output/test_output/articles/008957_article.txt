the clinton foundation will continue to accept donations from foreign governments despite the risk of a conflict of interest now that its founder is running for the white house . the charity announced on wednesday that it has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six . the change in policy comes as former board member hillary clinton undertakes her presidential campaign . the foundation 's reliance on funding from several middle east governments that suppress dissent and women 's rights — concerns that the state department focused on during her stint as secretary of state — sparked criticism and gave republicans a new offensive against the leading democrat . clinton resigned from the foundation 's board last week . scroll down for video . democratic presidential candidate hillary rodham clinton , pictured on tuesday , meets with local residents at the jones st. java house in leclaire , iowa . she resigned from the board of the clinton foundation last week . the bill , hillary and chelsea clinton foundation 's board said on wednesday night that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of australia , canada , germany , the netherlands , norway and the united kingdom — all nations that previously supported the charity 's health , poverty and climate change programs . longtime u.s. allies , the six maintain relatively uncontroversial ties to the u.s . while direct contributions from other governments would be halted , those nations could continue participating in the clinton global initiative , a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity .  donations greater that $ 25million .  bill & melinda gates foundation . clinton giustra enterprise partnership ( canada ) . fred eychaner . frank giustra , the radcliffe foundation . nationale postcode loterij . the children 's investment fund foundation . unitaid .  donations $ 10- $ 25million . ausaid . stephen l. bing . copresida . tom golisano . government of norway . the hunter foundation * kingdom of saudi arabia * the victor pinchuk foundation . cheryl and haim saban & the saban family foundation * the elma foundation . theodore w. waitt . however , the foundation will stop holding cgi meetings abroad — a final session is scheduled for morocco in may — and most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs . clinton foundation donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $ 55 million and $ 130 million . in addition to the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating , the others were saudi arabia , qatar , oman , the united arab emirates , algeria , kuwait , italy , brunei , taiwan and the dominican republic . the foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually — an answer to long-standing criticism that the foundation 's once-a-year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity 's funding . former president bill clinton and other foundation officials have long defended the charity 's transparency , but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns , particularly as his wife begins her race for the white house . hillary clinton 's campaign referred questions about the board 's action to the foundation . last month , while she was still a board member , clinton defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments , saying the foundation had ' hundreds of thousands of donors .
