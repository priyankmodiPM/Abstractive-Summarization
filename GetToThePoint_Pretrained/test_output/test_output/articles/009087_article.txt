there 's nothing more exciting that when a whole league season comes down to the wire , with two or perhaps three teams still in contention right up to the last few weeks . but sir alex ferguson 's favourite phrase for this scenario , ' squeaky bum time ' , does n't begin to cover the current situation in algeria 's championnat national de premiere division . with four rounds of matches remaining , just 11 points split leaders es setif and bottom-placed na hussein dey , meaning , theoretically , that any of the 16 teams in the league could still be crowned champions . the current state of the algerian league table , which sees all 16 teams in with a shout of the championship . algerian football fans are in for an exciting - if incredibly tense - final few rounds of the season . the insanely tight league table means that a bad run for any of the teams in the top half could yet condemn them to relegation , while a series of wins for those near the bottom could yet propel them to glory . with 12 points left to play for , there is everything still to play for . the top two teams qualify for next year 's caf champions league , while the team in third make the caf confederation cup , africa 's equivalent of the europa league . the algerian league certainly has a claim to be the most exciting in the world at the moment . three teams will be relegated to the second division and with the goal difference column all over the place , anything could happen yet . last year 's champions usm algier are currently in fifth place but are just four points off the top . to add to the suspense , the league now pauses for a month . and it goes without saying that the final day of the season on june 12 will be a tense affair .
