royal bank of scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘ tough year’ . the state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a £446million loss for the first three months of the year . it comes after rbs was forced to put aside £856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided , including an extra £334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks . down : rbs reposted a £446million loss in the first three months of the year . in addition to fines in the us , the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the uk . rbs was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the us . the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time for chancellor george osborne , six days before the general election . a return to profit for both rbs and state-backed lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the labour government in 2008 . lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector , but the losses at rbs suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis . disgraced former rbs boss fred goodwin ( pictured ) was among those courted by former prime minister tony blair . mr goodwin was knighted for ‘ services to banking’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 . chief executive ross mcewan said : ‘ this is going to be another tough year . there are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon . we look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues . ’ the latest news wiped more than £700million off the value of rbs as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p . the tories have blamed the last labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power . the disgraced former boss of rbs , fred goodwin , was among those courted by former prime ministers tony blair and gordon brown . mr goodwin – nicknamed fred the shred for his ruthless cost-cutting – was even knighted for ‘ services to banking’ in 2004 . he was stripped of his title in 2012 . jonathan isaby , of the taxpayers’ alliance , said : ‘ these losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank . ‘it’s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens , so it remains crucial that rbs gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible . ’
