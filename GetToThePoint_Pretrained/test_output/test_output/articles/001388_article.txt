a singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner . captured in a front room in bahama , north carolina , the three dogs – a husky called sky , a brown and white springer spaniel called sadie and a black and white springer spaniel called marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage . getting the tune underway , sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on sky’s ear as if whispering something – sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction . the video begins with sadie the springer spaniel barking and interacting with the husky named sky . the springer spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the husky joins it , but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl . following the husky’s lead , the spring spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another . meanwhile the other springer spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner . no , it 's like this ! the husky begins howling , causing the springer spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . all together now ! the three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl , which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo . the trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder . the howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up . no encore ? the owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying : ‘ hey , hey , hey , come on , come on . ’ and the three dogs , rather put out about being interrupted , stopping and turning to look at him in surprise .
