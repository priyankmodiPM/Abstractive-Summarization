daniel levy reportedly told the tottenham hotspur supporters ' trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for gareth bale , future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players , priced between £10-15million with good potential for resale . this may be financially sensible , but it is hardly reassuring . elite clubs , those who challenge for the biggest trophies , do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at manchester united by trading top performers such as michael carrick and dimitar berbatov . indeed , the only time tottenham demonstrated real champions league potential was when levy resisted the likes of chelsea over luka modric . tottenham chairman daniel levy is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value . spurs sold forward gareth bale ( left ) to real madrid in 2013 for a world-record £85 million transfer fee . spurs ' best chance of securing regular champions league football came when luka modric played for them . spurs allowed star performers dimitar berbatov ( left ) and michael carrick ( right ) to join manchester united . the moment they started to sell again , tottenham fell away . not even having the premier league 's top goalscorer in harry kane has placed them among the elite again — and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan . nobody overtakes manchester united by offering a helping hand — no matter how favourable the price . even the exploits of premier league top goalscorer harry kane has n't been enough to get spurs top-four .
