carl frampton has branded eddie hearn 's £1.5million offer to fight scott quigg as little more than a ' publicity stunt ' . hearn made the offer live on television on tuesday after talks between him and frampton’s promoter barry mcguigan had stalled . but belfast 's ibf super-bantamweight world champion has called on the matchroom chief to make him a more realistic offer . super-bantamweight world champion carl frampton ( left ) has dismissed a fight offer from scott quigg . quigg ( right ) offered £1.5m to frampton for a british super-fight , via his promoter eddie hearn . 'it’s the biggest publicity stunt i’ve seen since that incident between justin timberlake and janet jackson at superbowl xxxviii ( when jackson 's breast was briefly exposed by timberlake ) , ' frampton wrote in his news letter column . ' [ it ] is undoubtedly a lot of money . but does that mean i should snap it up with both hands ? ' absolutely not , and there are a number of reasons why . 'it’s a flat rate offer , which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office , this is the most i’ll receive . ' if pay-per-view targets are reached this fight can bring in £10million and potentially as much as £12m . ' so please , the next time you make an offer , make it a realistic one . ' quigg showed off a £1.5m cheque ready to hand to frampton on sky sports earlier this week . but frampton has branded the gesture a ' publicity stunt ' and ridiculed the offer . hearn was quick to respond on twitter , saying : ' [ the ] fact is we are putting offers on the table and you are n't ! if the offer is that bad then make us one ? ' also , if it makes as much money as you stated in your link , why have you also turned down 60-40 for the winner ? ' hearn has earmarked july 18 at the manchester arena for the world title unification clash with nonito donaire and kiko martinez alternative opponents for quigg .
