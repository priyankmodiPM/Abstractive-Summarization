' it was just two silly challenges , not malicious , ' said dyche . ' but at least the referee got that one right . ' that was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with mr jones for denying burnley penalties for a john stones challenge on barnes and an attempt by mccarthy to bring down scott arfield . and he was furious that mirallas stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on george boyd early in the second half . ' that was the biggest one . it 's impossible he stays on the football pitch for a challenge like that , ' said dyche . ' high , late . i 've no clue why it was n't a red card .
