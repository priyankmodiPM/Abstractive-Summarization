' in america , robbie rogers played there . ' i think a lot of the problem is , as you say , it 's a fact that it will be out there , as it is in all modern life at all times , but i think we are probably at fault as a sport . ' i think that it 's that old syndrome where it 's a mans game and you ca n't talk about that . i have to say the game 's changing a lot . there are a lot of campaigns . i feel it in the dressing room . there 's a different feel about it . ' yeah there should be . i would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect . you know that thing about ' we 're macho we play football , ' is very old hat .

' everyone 's lining up to do that at the moment you know the punditry thing is the thing to do . everyone that retires wants to go in , and it 's not an easy thing . it looks quite easy to talk about football but it 's not .
