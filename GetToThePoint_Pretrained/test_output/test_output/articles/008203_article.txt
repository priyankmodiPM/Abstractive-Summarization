manchester united and liverpool target Â£25million memphis depay has held talks with paris st germain this week with the permission of his club psv eindhoven . the dialogue between psg and depay represents a threat to the premier league clubs with the qatari-backed french club understood to have made a significantly better financial offer than liverpool . united have yet to hold detailed talks with the player but have informed psv of their wish to do so while liverpool have established a good relationship with the club and would be serious contenders to sign the wide player if united 's offer does not match their own . memphis depay ( centre ) has held talks with psg , despite liverpool and manchester united 's interest . holland player depay ( right ) has caught the eye of clubs over europe with good form for club and country . louis van gaal gave depay his international debut but could miss out on bringing him to old trafford . however , depay is intrigued by the prospect of playing with zlatan ibrahimovic and is good friends with gregory van der wiel , his team-mate in the holland national team , who is also at psg . with bayern munich also considering a move for the winger , a move to the premier league is in the balance though if united firm up their interest , they clearly have an advantage . louis van gaal gave depay his international debut for holland and the player also worked under van gaal 's assistant , albert stuivenberg in the holland under-17 team which won the 2011 european championships .
