' scroll down for video . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu slammed the iran nuclear deal , claiming it threatens the jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . one of netanyahu 's scathing comments was shared on his twitter page during his speech . the preliminary agreement set out a framework where iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions . they will also be subjected to inspections . if they are found to be in violation of the terms , the sanctions will be put back in place . the deal does mean however that iran 's nuclear program will be able to operate for the next 10 years , even though it is ceasing its enrichment activities at fordow - an underground facility discovered by the americans . it prompted netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on iran by western powers until a better deal is reached . he said : ' this deal would legitimize iran 's nuclear program , bolster iran 's economy , increase iran 's aggression & terror throughout the me [ middle east ] & beyond . ' such a deal would not block iran 's path to the bomb . it would pave it . ' such a deal would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war . ' the alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on iran until a better deal is achieved . in response , the white house said in a statement , seen by nbc , that ' progress on the nuclear issue in no way diminishes our concerns with respect to iran 's sponsorship of terrorism and threats towards israel , ' adding that ' the united states remains steadfast in our commitment to the security of israel . ' the deal made in lausanne , switzerland was announced by iranian foreign minister javad zarif and the european union 's head of foreign policy federica mogherini . they said negotiators had reached an agreement with tehran over its nuclear program and talks would move into the next phase . after speaking to president barack obama ( pictured thursday during the announcement of the agreement ) on the phone , he said in a statement : ' a deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of israel . obama ( pictured making a speech on the economy in louisville , kentucky ' added that if iran follows through then one of the greatest threats to american security will be resolved . speaking in the rose garden on thursday , obama said : ' if we can get this done , and iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to , we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security , and to do so peacefully . but , he added : ' if iran cheats , the world will know it . ' and ' if there is backsliding ' and iran does n't meet certain specifications ' there will be no deal . ' as zarif and mogherini were preparing to give a joint statement in lausanne , switzerland , this afternoon iranian president hassan rhouianni tweeted : ' solutions on key parameters of iran case reached . drafting to start immediately , to finish by june 30th .

' british foreign secretary philip hammond also said there was much more work to be done , but highlighted the success of the talks . he said : ' this is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what i believe could be a very good deal . ' german chancellor angela merkel added : ' we are closer than ever to an agreement that makes it impossible for iran to possess nuclear weapons . that is a great credit to all negotiating partners . ' the white house had repeatedly said that in order for it to enter into a commitment with tehran it must promise to ' shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon ' and ' comply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that theyâ€™re living up to the agreement . ' the date for work on that accord to be completed is june 30 . the preliminary agreement announced in switzerland on thursday is spelled out in a four-page document ( below ) released by the white house and the state department . here 's some of what iran is agreeing to do : in return , the west will : obama insisted that : ' if iran cheats , the world will know it ' . he added if tehran did n't meet certain conditions there would be no deal .
