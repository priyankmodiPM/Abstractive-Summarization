' we thank barca for the deal they offered the player and the efforts they have gone to try to renew his contract , ' el ouriachi 's agent , raul verdu , told catalan newspaper sport . ' but another proposal was really interesting on both a professional and economic level . ' moha has the option of joining the first team squad at stoke and that was irresistible . ' stoke have already signed bojan krkic and marc muniesa from barcelona in the last two years . el ouriachi has represented spain at youth level and sport reported that stoke have agreed to pay the necessary training compensation to bring the pacey left winger to the barclays premier league . both bojan and muniesa have settled well at stoke , although the former - who had scored five goals in 18 appearances following his shock move last summer - was ruled out for the rest of the season after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in an fa cup tie at rochdale in january . defender muniesa has made nearly 40 appearances since joining from barcelona in the summer of 2013 but has not featured since tearing a hamstring in the fa cup defeat at blackburn in february .
