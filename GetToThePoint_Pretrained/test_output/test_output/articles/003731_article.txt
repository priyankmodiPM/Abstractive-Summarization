' a second tweet pointed out how the pilots were in violation of the ' safe cockpit ' rules and are subject to a Â£260 fine , at the very least . the safety breach comes amid heightened concerns over aviation security after the germanwings airliner crash in which all 150 people on board died when the plane 's co-pilot deliberately flew the airbus jet into the ground . captain : turan , pictured right , challenges for the ball during the game last week . la liga star : turan plays in midfield for atletico madrid on saturday , in a 2-0 win over cordoba .
