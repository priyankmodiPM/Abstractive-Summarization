worried : alice dreger attended the class at east lansing high school after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand . an outraged mom live tweeted her son 's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance . author alice dreger took to twitter to express her horror at what she heard at east lansing high school , in michigan , when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week . ms dreger , a respected professor , began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex . according to the 45 tweets sent by ms dreger during the lesson , stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant , people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts . ' the whole lesson here is `` sex is part of a terrible lifestyle . drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster '' , ' tweeted ms dreger . she added : ' i feel like raising my hand and saying `` can i tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? '' ' ms dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students , who are freshmen in high school , by the teacher , who did not normally work at the school . at one point , paper babies were handed around the class to show how ' easily ' condoms fail : the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times . `` we are going to roll this dice eight times , ' ms dreger reported the teacher as saying . ' every time your number comes up , in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby . ' in fact , according to the nhs , just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly . outrage : ms dreger 's tweets , above , show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . untrue : the school has denied it only teaches abstinence , saying it just happened to be that day 's lesson . the tweets went viral , with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education . but the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day 's lecture which focused on the subject . 'abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe , but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices . this parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught , ' high school principal coby fletcher said in the statement released to the lansing state journal . the school has taken no direct action against ms dreger for the tweets . they have , however , banned her from the premises - apart from her son 's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson . @ alicedreger : the kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is , so i 'm going . but hands over my mouth means i ca n't live-tweet it . @ alicedreger : uh oh . they stuck me in the corner with my computer and there is wifi ... .so i can live tweet this . we still pledge loyalty to the flag , huh ? @ alicedreger : i ca n't stand this . they 're teaching `` abstinence stories '' that worked and non-abstinence '' stories that `` led to consequences . `` @ alicedreger : the visitor-teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex . my kid is trying to show her studies that dispute that . @ alicedreger : she 's being completely condescending . `` you can look up anything on the internet '' then refers him to site on abstinence education ! @ alicedreger : i feel like raising my hand and saying `` can i tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? '' @ alicedreger : and how i 've had a lot of lovers and have never gotten pregnant by accident ? yes , i had hpv ! and i would get the vaccine ! @ alicedreger : in fact i have had the vaccine ! @ alicedreger : now we 're hearing a horror story about marijuana use . @ alicedreger : the regular health teacher in trying to shut my kid up referred to `` lgbyt . '' and how the board decides what we learn . @ alicedreger : the guy telling the `` abstinence '' story is now telling us about having sex as a teenager . i 'm confused . @ alicedreger : now he 's talking about getting a girl preg and them hiding it from their parents . yup , that 's what sexual shame does , dude ! @ alicedreger : preg girl got picked on so her friends desserted her . that 's what happens if you have sex , kids ! yup ! pregnant and no friends ! @ alicedreger : he and the girl both had alcoholic fathers . but somehow he 's not recommending never drinking . @ alicedreger : the whole lesson here is `` sex is part of a terrible lifestyle . drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster '' . @ alicedreger : this guy really thinks this story of `` i f***** up for years and years '' is going to lead to other kids not f**** up . @ alicedreger : whereas the lesson i would take is `` sometimes it takes years to get your s*** together , and that 's okay '' ? @ alicedreger : oh and of course , now a story about a friend who od'ed and `` was a vegetable 11 years . tore their family apart . '' ffs . welcome to sex ed . @ alicedreger : this whole story of od 's , people in prison , out-of-marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy 's resilience and normalcy . @ alicedreger : `` i have a daughter whose 21 and i would go absolutely nuts if i knew she ever let a stranger into her house . '' @ alicedreger : `` i finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence , and her life was so much better . i put her on a pedestal above everyone else . '' @ alicedreger : `` i liked her so much [ i so wanted to **** her ] i decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence [ until i could f*** her ] . '' @ alicedreger : `` two years after we started dating i asked her to marry me and we 're 8 years married . '' and i 'll bet yer f**** , are n't ya ! @ alicedreger : `` we 're not saying having sex is a bad thing . my story i can say having sex was a bad thing for me because i craved it . '' @ alicedreger : `` you 'll find a good girl . if you find one that says ' no , ' that 's the one you want . '' he actually just said that . @ alicedreger : `` we can look up things on the internet but until you live that lifestyle you wo n't see it the same . '' the whole talk is `` lifestyle . '' @ alicedreger : now the woman is up . `` sometimes condoms fail . '' @ alicedreger : she says `` it is absolutely better to use something than nothing '' in terms of birth control . `` but it can fail . '' @ alicedreger : `` it takes only 1 sperm to fertilize an egg . it takes only 1 time having sex to get pregnant . '' yet she 's not suggesting oral or a*** . @ alicedreger : she 's now telling story of condom box in which every single condom had a hole . @ alicedreger : she says per the fda 1 out of every 400 boxes of condom can be totally defective . `` you might get that 400th box . '' be afraid ! @ alicedreger : about 18 % chance a condom will fail , she says . @ alicedreger : `` on average 1 out of 6 times there is a mishap with a condom . '' `` every day in us 1600+ teen pregnancies . '' lesson : condoms fail ? wtf ? @ alicedreger : condoms . they fail . you get pregnant . your friends leave you . you drop out of school . your kids end up in the army . @ alicedreger : `` we are going to roll this dice 8 times . every time your number comes up , in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby . '' j**** ! ! ! @ alicedreger : paper babies are being handed out to everyone . they have all had condom failure and the whole class is pregnant . @ alicedreger : `` you have to have a baby ! '' there are apparently no scissors in the room for paper abortions . @ alicedreger : `` i 'm going to collect the babies that you do n't want . we recycle them . '' @ alicedreger : `` safe sex is kind of a misnomer . '' @ alicedreger : it 's over . i need a drink . @ alicedreger : i ca n't get up . i 'm too stunned .
