from bear testicles and tiger paws to crocodile jaws and snake heads , these are just some of the bizarre animal parts being sold in china 's so-called medicine markets . traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) claims all manner of ailments including back ache , poor memory and even cancer can be cured by the natural world . it is often believed that the more endangered the animal is , the greater the healing affect it will have . such wisdom is widespread in guangzhou , where markets stock exotic and rare animals destined for restaurant menus , pharmacists and pet cages . however , a movement of fledgling organisations such as the south china nature society , run by student conservationists , is challenging centuries of tradition by trying to change consumer appetites in the country .

wildlife and the 2,000-year practice of traditional chinese medicine is the main catalyst behind the world 's third-largest illicit trade . guangzhou is the richest and most powerful city in southern china , with a keen taste for exotic animals and plants , seen as extreme even in other regions of china . the main reason for this is 2,000-year-old traditional chinese medicine that lists curative qualities in thousands of rare and exotic animals , such as the sumatran tiger . the pursuit of these traditions is the driving force behind the $ 20 billion ( £13bn ) illegal wildlife network , the worlds third largest elicit trade , surpassed only by arms and drugs . the network activity intensifies in south east asia home to rich biodiversity , well developed transport infrastructures , high profit margins and lax law enforcement , a haven for wildlife smugglers . vietnamese authorities recently seized a record haul of smuggled wildlife including two tons of tiger bones , bear paws and

consumption of endangered animals , but quite the opposite . rising incomes have allowed more consumers to indulge in exotic foods once considered exclusive delicacies for the rich . the consumption of these endangered animals have now become a symbol of guangzhou 's new wealth . a recent poll taken in guangzhou found that half the population had eaten wildlife , with snake being named as the favorite of half of those surveyed . a popular saying has it that people in guangzhou will eat anything with fours legs accept a chair , anything that flies accept a plane and anything in water except a boat . the greatest defense of animal rights to date was during the sars outbreak in 2003 when consumption dropped due to public fears about the risk of contracting sars from wild animals . an

in an international hub of exotic wildlife trade . ' our key objective is to raise awareness and educate consumers on the impact of their consumption . we hope that targeting the next generation will reduce future demand ' , explains feng . raising awareness and educating consumers takes a number of forms . the group organises various workshops and lectures in the local guangzhou 's universities . each month , they co-ordinate field investigation among the city 's live market and record the number of protected species . a tiger farmer attempts to sell a bengal tiger paw for $ 3,000 ( £2,000 ) in the qingping area of guangzhou . the global population of tigers has been reduced by 95 per cent as a result of hunting and poaching for their body parts , which are used in traditional chinese medicine . a seller weighs a tiger claw for a customer . the global population of tigers has been reduced by 95 per cent as a result of hunting and poaching for their body parts , which are used in traditional chinese medicine . their findings are reported to the authorities and published on the scns and green eyes websites . on recent visits to the city 's notorious live animal markets of qingping and huadiwan , scns identified a wealth of protected animals from koala bears to crocodiles to great white sharks . sun , a veteran snake seller at qingping , said the market sell fewer protected species than before because many animals are near extinction and government checks are tighter . however , he did admit to selling endangered species ' under the table ' including cobra .
