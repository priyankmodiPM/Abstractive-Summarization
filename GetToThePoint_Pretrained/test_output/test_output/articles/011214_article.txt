' while hedging its bets , the report basically concludes that sergeant bergdahl did not intend to remain away from the army permanently , as classic ' long ' desertion requires , ' fidell wrote . ' it also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office , ' he added . bowe bergdahl , shown before his handover to us troops in may 2014 . fidell declined to elaborate further on friday . bergdahl was released in exchange for five taliban leaders held at guantanamo bay . they were sent to qatar and had to remain there for a year . some u.s. lawmakers were angered by bergdahl 's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the guantanamo prisoners , as required by law . some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted . ' while many americans have taken a broader and more sympathetic view , the depth and breadth of the current hostility to sergeant bergdahl are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere , ' fidell said . ' taliban five ' : the terror leaders traded for bergdahl were ( top , from left ) : abdul haq wasiq , khirullah said wali khairkhwa , mohammad nabi omari ; and ( bottom from left ) : mohammad a fazl , mullah norullah noori . he faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy . a former platoon-mate of bergdahl told daily mail online that bergdahl is trying to win a public-relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy . cnn reported based on a pentagon leak , that bergdahl told army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report ' a breakdown in discipline and order ' to military higher-ups â€“ not with desertion in mind . ' this is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial , ' said retired sgt . jordan vaughn , who spoke for the first time since the army announced bergdahl would be court-martialed . ' no logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying , ' vaughn told daily mail online . he said the claim broadcast by cnn is ' ridiculous , ' and that the army 's decision to charge bergdahl with desertion is ' in direct conflict ' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle-blower . cnn reported that a defense department official said bergdahl had ' concerns about leadership issues at his base . ' he needs to be held responsible for what he did , for abandoning his post , for abandoning his platoon , for putting thousands of american soldiers , marines and the whole united states military , thousands of members , in more danger , putting us into spots we would n't already have been in , had he not walked away , ' he said . president barack obama announced the return of bergdahl on may 31 , 2014 in a white house rose garden press event as the soldier 's parents jani ( left ) and bob ( right ) looked on . vaughn also noted that his decision ' cost the us multiple soldiers ' lives , five taliban pows , and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him . ' however , both cornelison and buetow , who have left the us army , stopped short of demanding that sgt bergdahl face prison . ' i do n't want to ruin his life , ' said buetow . ' he does need to be dishonorably discharged , have all his ranks taken away , and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay . ' he added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the obama administration for negotiating with the taliban over a man accused of deserting . ' you ca n't get around the fact this makes some people look bad , ' he said . but they had little sympathy for sgt bergdahl 's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in taliban captivity . ' he would n't have been put in that position , he would n't have been tortured , he would n't have been put through all that hardship if he 'd never walked away , ' said cornelison . the punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court . it can reduce him to e-1 , forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge .
