it’s a shame to see another talented young player being photographed taking ‘ hippy crack . ’ it might be legal but it’s still a drug . if you want to be a top athlete you don’t want that in your body . in a strange way , maybe this story will actually help keep jack grealish’s feet on the ground . he was outstanding against liverpool but it was one game — he has not made it yet . jack grealish ( left ) has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxide . grealish starred for aston villa in their fa cup semi-final win over liverpool on sunday at wembley . at arsenal , arsene wenger changed the attitude completely . he said as professional athletes we had a duty to look after our bodies . alcohol was described as poison — it slows down your body when it needs to be perfectly tuned . you eat what’s required to refuel , not for pleasure . of course you still get players who want to enjoy themselves but there has to be a cut-off point . when i see jack play it’s no surprise that he is full of confidence . he has a big future but he has to make the right choices . that’s how you make sure you are on the back pages , not the front . emre can of liverpool tries to tackle grealish during their fa cup tie with aston villa at wembley .
