' if the cot’s side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all . ’ grace’s father gideon , who lives with his wife in haywards heath , west sussex , said : ‘ there are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little gracie . grace 's parents told the inquest ' we are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the princess royal hospital in haywards heath ( pictured ) , who did everything possible to try and save our little gracie ' . ‘ she was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling . we would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss . ’ the national children’s trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out . susie parsons , interim chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ this is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the roseman family at this time . ‘ we have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review . ’ bednest , which is based in stratford-upon-avon , is still selling the cribs on their website from £249 . the page boasts an endorsement from jools oliver , the wife of celebrity chef jamie . mrs oliver writes : ‘ we love the bednest ... i love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down . ‘ easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed . ’ a spokesman for bednest told mailonline : ‘ we are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to grace’s parents . ‘ we are doubly upset to hear this news , since the concept behind bednest’s design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses . ‘ it is not the case that the coroner has called the cot “dangerous” and asked for it to be withdrawn . ‘ the coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual , but due to a growing second-hand market for our bednest cribs , these instruction manuals may not be passed on . this may be , sadly , what happened with grace’s crib . ‘ we are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself . ’
