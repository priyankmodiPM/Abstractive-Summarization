' so we asked a few basic questions which threw him off and could n't answer even where he got his infantry training or even boot camp for that matter ... he 's a scum to america and we could n't let that fly . ' the incident comes after an angry army veteran called out a panhandler in tampa , florida last month for faking a military connection by wearing a camouflage uniform . garrett goodwin , who spent nearly 10 years in the army as a combat medic , spotted the allegedly phony veteran while driving down the main road to macdill air force base on sunday . when he first spoke with the beggar , goodwin started to get suspicious since he claimed to be special forces but was wearing a junior rotc patch on his uniform . he then had a friend record him as he went back up to the panhandler and demanded to see his veterans id card , which the unidentified panhandler said he did n't have . the clip then shows goodwin pursuing the beggar across a busy intersection as he berates the man for wearing a uniform that ' my brothers died in ' . the panhandler eventually discards of the uniform and goodwin tells him to not put it back on . while he ca n't be 100 per cent certain that the man he confronted is n't a veteran , he says he 's positive based on the panhandler 's shamed reaction , riding off on his bike after the incident .
