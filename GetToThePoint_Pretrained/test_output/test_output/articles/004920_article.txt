' her friend got dropped off first , but ronda never made it back home . three days later , her partially clothed body was discovered in a heavily wooded area almost 20 miles away from the bowling alley parking lot where she and her friend had hitched a ride . she had been violently assaulted and then stabbed to death . the man who gave her a ride home that day was never found . scroll down for video . ronda blaylock ( above ) was just 14-years-old in 1980 when she was found stabbed to death and brutally assaulted . this after she and a friend had taken a ride home from a man ( above ) after school in rural hall , north carolina . surry county sheriff graham atkinson ( above ) said in a press conference on monday the man still lives in the area and they are close to getting him . the camel city dispatch reports that the investigation into ronda 's death was relaunched after her mother , rebecca , called in to authorities recently to ask what progress had been made on her daughter 's case . ' within a day or so after receiving her call there were developments that i can not discuss here today , but this task force is actively pursuing good leads , ' surry county sheriff graham atkinson said in a press conference on monday . what they already knew is that the man was in his early twenties back in 1980 , drove a blue pickup truck with a white shell over the bed and went by jimmy , though he told the girls his friends called him butch . he would now be in his mid-to-late fifties . and while it has been years since the incident , some witnesses have been able to provide better information now than they could at the time the tragedy occurred .

' we feel like he has blended into the community and he 's lived with this for a long time and we 're hoping he does the right thing and comes forward . ' and if he does not come forward , sheriff atkinson has a message for him : ' make no mistake . we are coming for you . ' ronda 's mother meanwhile just wants closure after years of pain .
