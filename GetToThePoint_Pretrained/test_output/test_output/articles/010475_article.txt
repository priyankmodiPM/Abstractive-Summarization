' i may have been left with nothing from the last gambian woman i fell in love with , but my new girlfriend is different . ' she is wonderful and i feel blessed . it may be stupid but i always follow my heart . ' david with his last wide ndey , who was a bigamist . after divorcing his british wife of seven years in 1992 , the father-of-two never imagined he would find love again . with the help of his sons from his first marriage , david slowly overcame the heartbreak and put his life back together . it was n't until 1998 when he visited gambia on holiday that he fell in love with nyima sye . converting to islam and marrying her that year , david brought his beautiful new wife back to the uk but five years later their marriage ended and the pair divorced . david said : ' nyima was too young for me and eventually the cultural differences tore us apart . ' we split amicably but looking back now , she could have been after me for a british passport . i would never bring another gambian woman over to the uk because of that . ' david swore off women but 15 years later , everything changed when he joined a friend on another holiday to the west african country . just a few days into his stay , david met ndey , then 22 , a waitress who could speak good english . ndey in the town centre close to her home in gambia . the pair started talking and after she explained she was recovering from malaria and had lost her job in the restaurant , he offered to help . david started sending her £50 a week and even paid a cafe owner to give his new love a job , bank rolling her wages of £30 a week , unbeknownst to ndey . finally in june 2011 david had saved up enough money from his job as a van driver to fly back out to gambia to be with his love . he said : ' i booked another two-week holiday and packed my suitcase full of clothes and jewellery for ndey . ' i could n't wait to start our relationship and when i got there and she met me at the airport , it was more than i had ever dreamed of . ' leaving her to go back to the uk was heart breaking , i was already counting down the days until i could come back and see her . ' in october 2012 , 16 months later , david flew out to bakau in gambia with yet another suitcase of expensive gifts for his girlfriend . as well as securing a date for their wedding , david rented a flat out for her so they would have somewhere to stay whenever he returned to the country . in june 2013 , the pair wed at kanising islamic court in front of ndey 's sister and uncle - sadly none of david 's family made the trip for the wedding . david with ndey , who became pregnant with another man while they were married . returning to see his wife as often as he could afford , david planned to stay living in the uk until he retired from his job as a newspaper delivery driver . in february 2014 , ndey asked him if he could pay the £60 a month lease on a fashion shop she planned to open , which he agreed to do . even though she became pregnant with another man 's baby , david agreed to care for the child as if it were his won . on top of this , david paid £2,000 up front on clothes stock and began working overtime to pay for everything . but in october 2014 , he received a worrying text message from an unknown number which read : ' your wife has married a gambian man , is pregnant by him and living in his family compound in the town of bakau . ' david said : ' i was devastated . through tears she admitted she had cheated on me while i was back in england . ' she said she was now four months pregnant with his baby.it was heart breaking but at the end of the day , she was my wife . i agreed to raise the baby as my own . ' david bought maternity clothes and baby bits for ndey and in november 2014 he moved to gambia to live with his wife , but his happiness was short lived . later that month he received another anonymous text saying : ' your wife has three husbands , two white and one black . ' in the final moments of their relationship , suspicious david hired a private investigator to unearth the truth about his beloved wife who kept disappearing for weeks on end . within 48 hours they had tracked ndey down and discovered she was living in a compound with an illegitimate husband and his family . david added : ' words can not explain how distraught i was . i could n't believe she would do this to me , after everything i had done for her . my trust was completely shattered . ' in january this year david contacted the police and ndey was arrested and charged with bigamy and fraud . david with ndey on the day of their wedding . she was fined 15000 dalassi - ten years ' salary - and will face two years in prison if she fails to pay by the end of april . betrayed , david is now desperate to recover the £24,000 he spent on ndey over the last four years . he said : ' i refuse to divorce her until she pays me back every last penny . i have been left with nothing - no home in england , no pension , no savings , just £45 a week to live on . ' i ca n't even move back to the uk because i ca n't afford it . ' as they say , love is blind . after all those years i finally found love , and it totally backfired . ' our whole relationship was a lie , and i had no idea . the fact that she so willingly took my money as well is just heartless . the text david received telling him that his wife was pregnant with another man 's baby . ' looking back now , i should have seen the signs but i was a fool . a fair few people tried to warn me but i was having none of it . gullible does n't even cover it . ' despite everything he 's been through , david is now dating isatou jarju , 30 , a cafe owner who he met when isatou was working in a cafe with ndey . as isatou 's british husband had just left her , the pair bonded over their misfortune and although the relationship is still in the early stages , he says marriage ' is n't off the cards . ' he said : ' she is different to ndey and i can only hope it works this time . she seems trustworthy and never asks me for anything . ' she has her own business , home and is beautiful . above everything , she makes me laugh and has brought a smile to my face while i 've been dealing with everything . ' she is very special to me . ' not bothered by warnings from family and friends , david is hoping to prove them wrong with his third gambian lover . he said : ' my loved ones who know what has happened are absolutely disgusted that she would treat me like this . ' they think i 'm mad for dating another african lady but at the end of the day , they want me to be happy . ' although i 'm still angry and full of hatred for ndey , i just feel so lucky that i can finally have my happy ending . '
