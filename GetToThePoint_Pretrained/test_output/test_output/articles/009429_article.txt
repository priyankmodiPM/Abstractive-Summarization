' of course i want to continue to serve the country and serve my party , which i am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now . ’ he added : ‘ i want to lead the liberal democrats into and through the next parliament in all circumstances . ‘ all i am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very , very real risk that as the labour party and conservative party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another , there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically . ’ meet and greet : mr clegg ( far right ) speaks to voters and their families during a general election campaign visit to sutton with paul burstow ( second right ) the party 's candidate for sutton and cheam . his comments came as business secretary vince cable said he hoped to be made chancellor if the lib dems form another coalition with the conservatives . mr clegg also appeared to lean towards another deal with the tories , saying he deserved ‘credit’ for forming the coalition while he had endured ‘ five years of constant bile from the labour party , who condemned us vitriolically for taking decisions which we only had to take because we had to clear up the mess they left behind’ .
