' summarizing her last years , she said : ' my daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death , and she did it while laughing , painting , writing poetry , advocating and bringing joy to the people around her . ' she was the bravest person i have ever known , and her suicide doesnâ€™t change that .

' but my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that i could n't see .

' the second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom , the most powerful other influence in her life . ' each time she obeyed and relapsed , she plunged into a longer free fall , hitting the ground harder , recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau . ' according to the article , the final , ultimately fatal , change came last fall when natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all , and gave them up for good . fuller was not specific about what happened in natalie 's last weeks , though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter , she mentioned that she had holidayed in nicaragua with members of her family in february . fuller , the executive director of the treatment advocacy center charity has said since natalie 's death that she wants her ' legacy ' to be increased understanding and compassion for the those who have mental illnesses . treatment : when she featured in the video , natalie told how she was living in a treatment facility and caring for animals in a bid to get better . missing her : natalie would have been 29 last week -pictured above is a cake her mother had made for her .
