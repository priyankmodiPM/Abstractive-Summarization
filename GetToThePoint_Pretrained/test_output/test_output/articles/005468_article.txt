' she can have that , ' the spelman college graduate told the washington post . and it 's hard to blame her . solidcore 's website says it utilizes ' slow and controlled full-body movements with constant tension to work your muscle fibers to failure ... to rebuild a more sculpted , stronger and [ solid ] you . ' jarvis , instead , got her workouts by helping carry the first lady through her last seven years in the white house . she was with the obamas even before that , however . jarvis entered the family 's orbit in 2005 when she joined obama 's senate office . she went on to work on obama 's 2008 campaign and then michelle 's staff leading up to the election before becoming her top personal aide . her relationship with the family , insiders say , was deeply familial .

' that confidence and loyalty has now won her a job near the top of a $ 10 billion corporate foundation . the ford foundation , created in 1936 by auto moguls henry and edsel ford , funds charities and individuals worldwide that encourage and ' promote among the nonprofit , government and business sectors ; and to ensure participation by men and women from diverse communities and all levels of society .
