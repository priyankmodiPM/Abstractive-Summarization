information . investigators believe lubitz locked his captain out of the a320’s cockpit on march 24 and deliberately crashed the plane , killing all 150 people on board – possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot’s licence . citing sources from the investigation , german newspaper bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off work and wanted to get better so he could fly again . it said he gave them information about his job as a pilot and his employer , germanwings , but concealed that he was still working . he was apparently more stable in

, in the home country of the airline , at courts in the passenger 's destination or in the passenger 's home country . but in air crashes , the amounts awarded for pain and suffering vary by country

to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the airbus a320 to descend . once out of the cockpit , the door locked automatically . ironically , this auto-lock feature , which led to lubitz having sole control of the plane , was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11 . scroll down for video . the airbus a-320 is fitted with a safety system , pictured

locking mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck while the aircraft is in flight . the door was also specially strengthened , to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through . the safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft . access to the cockpit door on the germanwings airbus a320 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . in normal flight , the door to the flight is closed and locked . cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck . entry is controlled by the flight crew , in case of a possible hijack attempt . the cockpit door locking system ( cdls ) according to the flight manual ' provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door ' . the cdls is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door . they also have a cctv camera so they can see who is seeking access , and if they are under any form of duress . pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency . however , this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes . the limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature , in case the flight crew become incapacitated . after the predetermined time , the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again , unless the pilot actively restricts access again . also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open . the pilot has to flick one simple switch , pictured , to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes .
