' my goal was to look after my car . i had no real threat from nico throughout the whole race . ' a visibly angry rosberg replied : ' it 's just now interesting to hear from you lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race . nico rosberg ( left ) accused hamilton of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under pressure . ' driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then i had to cover him . ' it was unnecessarily close with sebastian as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him . then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that . ' the spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre , and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded . it culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the belgian grand prix , resulting in rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team . this proved to be a turning point in the championship as hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown .
