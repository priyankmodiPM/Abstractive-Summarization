' but i think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and i do n't think there needs to be another because of this . i do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the taylor report came up with the right answers for football . mr fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster , when she told him it had not been heginbotham 's first fire . the charred remains of a bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed .

' author martin fletcher writes about his own experience at the bradford disaster , and asks why chairman stafford heginbotham was not investigated : ' why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family , who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him , who somehow got out of the stand , as the last person to get out , the only person to get out the front after being at the back , and the only person to survive the smoke ? ' heginbotham 's son , james , 47 , told the daily mirror today : ' when you actually do your homework and see what he did for bradford city football club it is a sickening accusation . it is just absolutely ridiculous . ' he never recovered from the fire . the stress of it is what killed him eventually . it was a shock hearing this today , it was such a long time ago . ' he 's no longer here to defend himself . it 's a real shame it has come to this . ' he devoted his entire life to that club . he saved the club on two separate occasions . ' i have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club .
