' in the last match our opponent had 22 fouls and we had five . the way we play it 's not easy for our players to be booked . ' the game is a three points game . we need points , we need victories . it does n't make sense to think about some games ( arsenal and manchester united ) and not about others . ' we have to win every game . we have to win the next game . we do n't think about the points we have or the match we have in hand .
