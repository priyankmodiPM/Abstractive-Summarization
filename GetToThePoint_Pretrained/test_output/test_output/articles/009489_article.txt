john carver will turn to siem de jong in a bid to save newcastle’s sorry season . the £6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in february and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign , especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem . de jong has started just one premier league game since arriving from ajax and he was only days away from a return to action following a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung . newcastle attacking midfielder siem de jong could return to action before the end of the current campaign . de jong , pictured in training on april 9 with his team-mates , will feature for newcastle 's reserve side . however , the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for united’s reserves when they entertain derby county at st james’ park on wednesday night , as will england under 19 winger rolando aarons . sunday’s visit of spurs will probably come too soon for de jong and hamstring absentee aarons – who has not played since november - but carver will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note . newcastle have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from . they have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five-match winning run under alan pardew last autumn . supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with spurs , where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at mike ashley’s running of the club . newcastle boss john carver will be hoping his side will improve following the return of de jong .
