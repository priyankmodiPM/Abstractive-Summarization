' and rigid-soled boots must be worn to kick steps across old , hard snow patches . ' do n't be fooled into thinking that a pair of lightweight slip-on snow-spikes will do the job . they wo n't . ' crampons that are not securely clipped and strapped to your boots will roll off as soon as you leave flat ground . ' simon steer , chairman of scottish mountain rescue , added : ' it 's a sad fact that the beautiful , yet deceptive conditions on the hills at easter means that this is often a busy time for the volunteers in the mountain rescue teams . ' we hope that hill goers will heed advice of the mcofs to avoid getting into difficulties which can place both themselves and their rescuers at risk . ' the scottish avalanche information service has rated the avalanche hazard for creag meagaidh as ' high ' and ' considerable ' for glen coe , lochaber and northern and southern cairngorms . anyone with information on mr knox 's whereabouts is urged to contact police scotland on 101 .
