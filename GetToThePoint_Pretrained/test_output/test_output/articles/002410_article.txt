' this is equivalent to a migrant-to-population share of almost 28 per cent , ' mr pezzullo said . ' and the composition of that population is changing in ways that the proponents of ' white australia ' could never have imagined . ' while a record 185,000 permanent migrants moved to australia in 1969 - this figure is likely to be exceeded in 2015 as people are moving to the lucky country in droves . mr pezzullo pointed out that the nation 's 'well-crafted and targeted ' immigration program towards skilled migrants was a significant factor to the increase of people uprooting to australia . ' migrants enjoy high levels of economic participation as distinct from high levels of social exclusion and welfare-dependency , he said . ' immigration has beneficial impacts in terms of growth in the demand for goods and services , increases in national income and living standards , improved labour participation , expansion of the economy 's productive capacity and growth in household consumption and public revenues , ' mr pezzullo said .
