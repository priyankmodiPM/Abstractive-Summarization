' this was unavoidable in order to prevent the complete destruction of certain parts of the front , which was expected to occur in a short time , and , in doing so , to save as many people as possible for germany . ' accordingly , on 9 may 1945 0100 gst every ongoing combat activity must be abandoned . ' all officers of the army , navy and the luftwaffe , as well as troops of the wehrmacht divisions and the waffen ss shall remain in their current positions . ' effective immediately , no maritime vehicle or aeroplane shall be sunk or destroyed , no military equipment may be damaged in any way . ' he finished the message with a stark warning that if his officers ' do not act according to the conditions of surrender , the command of the allied expeditionary forces and soviet command will undertake punitive measures or other steps beyond the conditions of surrender . ' von greim , 52 , a wwi fighter ace , had been put in charge of the luftwaffe after hitler turned on herman goering accusing him of treason . railing against his former comrades , hitler summoned von greim to berlin and ordered him to hunt down and kill gestapo chief heinrich himmler who he believed had tried to harbour a peace deal with the allies . the order was seized from luftwaffe chief robert von greim when he was arrested that day . von greim escaped berlin in a camouflaged plane and his actions thereafter are unknown until he was arrested in austria by us troops on may 8 . on his arrest , von greim admitted to his captors : ' i am the head of the luftwaffe , but i have no luftwaffe ' . he was taken to salzburg and was due to be handed over to the soviets but committed suicide by taking a cyanide pill on may 24 . the note is one of the only copies of doenitz 's dispatch known to exist today . it is tipped to fetch £21,000 when it goes under the hammer at bonhams auction house on behalf of a private collector from the us . tom lamb , an expert in military history at bonhams , said : ' the story behind this document is an incredible one . ' hitler was in his bunker in berlin a few days prior to his death and he called von greim , one of his closest and most trusted allies . ' von greim was flown in to berlin amid all the fighting . that evening hitler launched a rant about how his right hand man heinrich himmler had betrayed him . ' hitler ordered von greim to go and kill himmler for treason then take control of the luftwaffe following the treason of goering . ' von greim left immediately in his camouflaged plane and amazingly managed to escape out of berlin without being caught . ' he was supposed to go to plon in northern germany to track down himmler but he was arrested on may 8 , the same day as the german surrender , by us troops in austria . ' hitler had committed suicide a week earlier and admiral doenitz had taken charge . on may 7 1945 doenitz had signed the instrument of surrender and the following day he sent his high command a dispatch informing them . ' doenitz warned that if the germans did n't stop fighting they would be killed by the americans or the russians . ' he understood the end had come and he was telling his high command to make sure everyone knew that . ' the telegram from doenitz was found on von griem when he was arrested . ' von greim was then taken to salzburg where he was due to be part of a soviet-us prisoner exchange but fearing torture at the hands of stalin he took his own life with a cyanide pill . ' copies of the surrender note from doenitz are exceptionally rare - many were lost or destroyed but somehow this one survived . ' this document is incredibly important in the history of the 20th century . ' the auction will take place in new york on april 29 .
