' as one of murray 's fiercest rivals on the court , it 's not surprising djokovic is n't at the top of the guest list but it seems that , unlike a lot of famous faces , the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite . murray has said : ' there wo n't be any celebrities as such . ' i do n't have any celebrity friends so it was n't something that was planned . ' [ it 'll be ] everyone who we 're close to , people we 've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future . ' that 's how we came up with the names . pretty much everything is done now and under control . i 'm sure a few things will come up next week but it 's pretty much sorted . ' who made the list ? british player jamie delgado ( left ) is a close friend of murray 's but celebrity pals such as james corden ( right ) , who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the us , wo n't be attending . there will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of nadal or federer . murray has invited dutch doubles player jules rojer , who he spends time with while training in miami and davis cup team mate james ward . another british pro jamie delgado will also attend . bride-to-be kim was spotted cheering on her fiancé this weekend as he battled novak djokovic in the men 's final at the miami open before the couple fly back to scotland ahead of their nuptials . for the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community . it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former wimbledon champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel cromlix house in nearby kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day . the reception will be held at cromlix , which murray owns . there 's a friendly rivalry on court between andy murray and tennis world number one novak djokovic but the serbian wo n't be attending murray 's nuptials this weekend . lady in waiting : kim sears watched her husband-to-be lose to novak djokovic in the miami open in key biscayne , florida last weekend . hundreds of well-wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at dunblane cathedral , before andy and kim hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel cromlix house . the 300-seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at cromlix , which seats only 28 . thousands are expected to line dunblane high street on the day . murray’s uncle niall erskine said : ‘i’m sure it will be a popular decision , as he’s had so much support from the people of dunblane in the past . andy has admitted that , food aside , he 's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed : 'kim’s been pretty much doing it ' . 'i’ve tried to help out when she has asked , but i haven’t been over-involved . i did all the food and cake tasting which i really enjoyed , although i didn’t think i was going to . he added : 'it’s a big day for kim . pretty much everything is taken care of now . she seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change .
