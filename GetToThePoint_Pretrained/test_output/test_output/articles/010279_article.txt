' i took him to my house and he was so withdrawn and crying the whole time , ' she said . ' his best friend adam and i were on 24 hour suicide watch . ' it was the worst time of my life - i have never seen him so low . ' ten days later , chris told his mother that holly was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends . the next morning , kerrie was unable to get hold of chris in her break at work so she asked her husband and jayden to check on him . ' they heard music but he did n't answer the door so they broke it down and it was jayden who found him . ' only a year apart in age , jayden and chris were not only brothers but best friends . ' jayden and my husband were having terrible nightmares - jay kept seeing visions of chris as he saw him when he broke the door down , ' kerrie said . ' the next day queensland mental health offered us counselling - i just ca n't get my head around that they would n't help chris when he was alive but offered us counselling after he died . ' before chris became unwell two years ago , he was a happy and outgoing boy . chris with his girlfriend holly and his beloved dog , bear , in happier times . kerrie , who works for the health department as an aged care nurse , has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals . ' i will hand deliver the petition to canberra myself and hope the bloody politicians listen , ' she said . ' mental health is rampant in my family so if any other family members show any sign they have no hope . ' i do n't know if i could cope losing another child i think it would be the thing that breaks me - my days are filled with fear . ' no matter what happens , kerrie will always treasure the fond memories of her beautiful son . ' he was the most beautiful boy - he really loved his family - he would walk in and say `` i love you mother duck '' and give me a big hug and kiss , ' she said .
