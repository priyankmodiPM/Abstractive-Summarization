' it 's beautiful . you should see it . unfortunately , porn is not so aesthetic and so beautiful . but love is sex also , you know ? ' this kind of story for the ones who have seen it - i 'm sure nobody has seen it - it 's too beautiful . ' this kind of story , when you choose to do it , you have to know the director . if it 's somebody special , if it 's a real artist , you can do it . you can give , and be confident enough . ' cantona has defended the film , saying it is ' a work of art ' and ' beautiful ' , and not a porn film as some have said . in one scene , cantona is on his hands and knees in his pants while a woman with a whip stands over him . cantona stars alongside french actress beatrice dalle , playing a character named ' the stud ' , and the film has been both praised and slated in equal measure . while one called it a ' superb artistic orgy ' , another reviewer branded it ' a film that confuses the audience and falls in the gap between arthouse and trashy farce .
