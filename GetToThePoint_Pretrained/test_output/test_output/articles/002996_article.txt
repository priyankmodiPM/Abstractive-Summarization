many rejoiced yesterday as hillary clinton finally announced her long-awaited campaign to be president of the united states , marking the start of her fight ' to earn your vote ' . but this political operator was less than impressed with the news , bursting into tears and complaining that the former first lady and secretary of state had stolen his thunder . zeke celello , who appears to be around two years old , was overcome with emotion when clinton declared her second presidential bid , and insisted to his mother that 2016 is his year to shine . devastated : zeke celello burst into tears when hillary clinton announced that she was running . more experience : clinton , 67 , pictured above declaring her intention to run , has better washington connections than zeke . the video , uploaded by his mother erin to facebook in the wake of the announcement , sees the would-be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation 's highest office so he could ' play ... with toys ' . he eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a commander-in-chief , but is still adamant that he is up to the task . unfortunately , zeke appears not to have realized that the u.s. constitution prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35 . however , unperturbed , he eventually takes his mother 's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway . zeke admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of clinton , who already has to her name a period as secretary of state , a spell in the u.s. senate and eight years as first lady . but he does have the advantage of youth over 67-year-old clinton , and , unlike his more experienced rival , will not be perceived as a political insider . accepting ms celello 's campaign advice , he repeats : ' i 'm zeke and i 'm running for president . ' while he has yet to articulate a policy platform , the youngster is clearly not short on ambition .
