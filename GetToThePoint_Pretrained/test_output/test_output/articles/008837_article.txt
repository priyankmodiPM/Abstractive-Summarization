' back in 2010 , manny was still growing into a welterweight . his first two welterweight fights were against oscar de la hoya in 2008 and miguel cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively , and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight ricky hatton . ' floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against de la hoya so that might have given floyd an advantage . i still like manny 's chances in that fight but i think the manny of today has a lot more in his favour . pacquiao is better equipped to beat mayweather now than he was in 2010 , according to his trainer roach . mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets pacquiao next month . the pair will go head-to-head in a $ 300million mega-fight at the mgm grand in las vegas on may 2 . ' in 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either , but that 's not true today . floyd at 38 is doing things he did n't do in the past . floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years . mayweather remains the bookmakers ' favourite for the $ 300million mega-fight next month but roach is adamant that pacquiao is primed to cause an upset . ' the 2015 version of manny is more mature , smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version , ' said roach . ' he will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating floyd 's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening . ' i have all the confidence in the world that manny is going to knock floyd out on may 2 . '
