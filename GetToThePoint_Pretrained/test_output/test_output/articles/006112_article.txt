mi5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in britain’s nuclear , transport and public services after suicide pilot andreas lubitz killed 150 people in the alps plane crash disaster . and concerns are so great that one security source has warned : ‘ however much physical security you have , if someone is already in there , there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism . ’ mi5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the germanwings disaster . warning : mi5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in britain’s nuclear , transport and public services after co-pilot andreas lubitz killed 150 people in the alps plane crash disaster . co-pilot andreas lubitz , who was being treated for depression , was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground . guidance issued by the centre for the protection of national infrastructure ( cpni ) , a security agency accountable to the director general of mi5 , recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees , with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public . but a ba pilot , who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world , claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks . the pilot , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ british airways is more interested in checking whether i have a hernia than mental health . ‘ there is no testing regarding mental health . ’ a ba spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots . the cpni has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat , including theft , revenge , a hunger for notoriety , political or religious ideology and fear or coercion , where external pressure is exerted on a worker . rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the germanwings airbus a320 . a cpni study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation , but whose loyalties changed after recruitment . disturbingly , it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue . some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of us whistleblower edward snowden – process corruption ( where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends ) and corporate espionage . the security source said : ‘ years ago , the emphasis was on external security . now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat , as seen in the cases of edward snowden and lubitz . ‘ we advise companies to look closely at their personnel . the higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment , the closer they should be monitored . ’
