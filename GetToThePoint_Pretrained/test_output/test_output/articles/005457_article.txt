sky sports pundit gary neville has laid into referee lee mason after he failed to award newcastle a penalty during their 2-0 defeat at liverpool on monday night . an incident in the 38th minute of the game , saw ayoze perez felled by a reckless challenge from dejan lovren . although replays clearly showed the defender scything perez down and not making contact with the ball , mason did not point to the spot . neville said during his analysis , ' it was an absolute stonewall penalty . the gasp in the ground , lovren just kicks him right in the knee . ' ayoze perez drives into the liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by dejan lovren . lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball , sending the spaniard tumbling . sky sports pundit gary neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the magpies at anfield . he added that mason 's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call . ' i think we said it last week , in the game , we always look at the ref 's position . but you look at lee mason 's view of it and he 's got no excuse , he 's staring right at it there , he 's so close , within five or six yards . it 's just a poor decision . ' before lovren 's foul , raheem sterling had put liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes ; and joe allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from mike williamson . the misery was only to be compounded for newcastle , as stand-in captain moussa sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence . with newcastle trailing 1-0 , a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game , but nothing was given . perez lies on the ground as glenn johnson ( left ) clears the ball and lovren ( right ) protests his innocence . moussa sissoko ( right ) hands the captain 's armband to his manager after he is sent off for a stamp .
