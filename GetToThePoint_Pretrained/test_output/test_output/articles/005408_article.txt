john carver has challenged his newcastle players to relieve the pressure on their shoulders by adding another dent to liverpool 's champions league hopes . the reds have slipped to seven points adrift of fourth-placed manchester city as a result of successive defeats by manchester united and arsenal , although things could have been worse had the champions managed to emerge from monday night 's trip to crystal palace with something to show for their efforts . brendan rodgers ' men ended their mini-slump on wednesday evening with a 1-0 fa cup quarter-final replay victory at blackburn , and carver knows they will will determined to add three points to that to keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish when the magpies head for anfield on monday evening . john carver says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against liverpool . he said : ' they are only seven points off it , i think , and they 'll think they have still got a chance , seven points off it with seven games to go . ' i remember our football club having a huge gap for ( to win ) the championship and it dwindling away , so anything is possible . ' they 'll think they 've still got a chance of getting into that top four , and i 'll be very surprised if the manager does n't prepare his team thinking like that , so we know we are going to have a difficult game . brendan rodgers and his side have slipped out of the top four and out of champions league contention . ' but there 's a bit of pressure on ourselves as well . ' that pressure comes specifically because of sunday 's 1-0 derby defeat at sunderland , the magpies ' fifth successive reverse in the fixture , but more generally as a result of a run of 13 games in all competition under their current head coach which has brought just two victories . newcastle have not added to their points tally of 35 since they beat aston villa on february 28 , some four games ago , and have scored just once in the process . the newcastle boss looks increasingly unlikely to get the job , with his results failing to impress . they remain nine points clear of the relegation zone , but with european challengers tottenham heading for st james ' park next weekend , the situation could get worse before it gets better . carver 's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire xi , and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders rolando aarons and siem de jong , the trip to merseyside will come too soon . carver said : ' i would say rolando is certainly ahead of siem de jong at the moment , but neither of those guys will be available this weekend . ' rolando aarons ( left ) and siem de jong are back in training but wo n't be available for monday night .
