troubling questions : lord janner controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the crown prosecution service said alzheimer’s has left him unfit to face trial . a former director of public prosecutions has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge lord janner with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him . lord macdonald qc , who was dpp between 2003 and 2008 , said that instead of consulting with headquarters in london , cps lawyers in leicestershire decided fresh evidence against janner was not worth pursuing through the courts . that decision meant janner , now 86 , was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the cps controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to alzheimer 's . speaking to the guardian , lord macdonald said : ' it is a matter of great regret that i was never informed of the existence of this case in 2007 . ‘ if it had been referred to me , i would certainly have given it my close and robust personal attention . ‘ the grave failure on the part of the local cps lawyers to refer this case to headquarters is no doubt one of the matters that ( high court judge ) sir richard henriques will be looking at in his review of these cases . ’ alison millar , head of the abuse team at law firm leigh day , who represented an alleged victim of lord janner , said : ' the main option now for those who allege they were abused by lord janner , to ensure their claims are investigated and for their voice to be heard , is through a civil legal claim . ' we are currently investigating the feasibility of such a legal challenge . ' the news comes after it was revealed last night that westminster attendance records show janner attended the house of lords almost daily and claimed more than £100,000 in expenses in the four years after he was diagnosed with the disease . he only stopped attending parliament – and claiming up to £300 a day for doing so – when child abuse police raided his house on december 2013 . even in that month he attended the lords 12 times . lord janner is said by his alleged victims to have preyed on young boys at care homes near his leicester west constituency . on thursday director of public prosecutions alison saunders said the peer would not be prosecuted because his condition means there could be no criminal conviction . she said there was evidence to charge janner with 22 sexual offences against children carried out between 1969 and 1988 , and that he should have been prosecuted in 1991 , when janner’s name was raised in a major paedophile trial , and again in 2007 . lord macdonald qc , director of public prosecutions from 2003 to 2008 , said the decision not to prosecute janner in 2007 was made by local cps lawyers , and new evidence was not passed to him . probes : greville janner , left in 1974 , served as an mp for decades and was investigated in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 . she went on to say that ‘ mistakes were made’ , and commissioned retired high court judge , sir richard henriques , to launch an inquiry . but her ruling means nine alleged victims will never have the chance to have their claims tested in court . and analysis of records shows janner continued speaking fluently for years after his diagnosis and was also alert enough to claim expenses among the highest in the lords . in the 12 months up to april 2009 , the year of his diagnosis , he attended the lords 143 times – only just shy of the 147 maximum possible . and he managed to fill in forms procuring himself £12,075 in subsistence payments and £13,468 in ‘ office costs’ – with another £691 in mileage claims for his car . in the following year , up to april 2010 , he attended 136 days at the lords out of a maximum 142 and claimed £10,986 subsistence , £11,625 office costs and £589 mileage . in the year to april 2011 he turned up 126 days out of 137 , and claimed expenses totalling £34,014 . in the year to april 2012 , janner attended 143 days out of a maximum of 156 . he also managed to claim a hefty £28,800 in expenses . in the following year , up to april 2013 , he turned up 136 days out of 144 , and claimed expenses totalling £24,600 . in april , may and june 2013 he attended every one of the 30 days the lords sat , claiming a total of £6,450 in expenses . in july he was absent just one out of 20 days , claiming £2,850 for the remaining 19 . pointing : channel 4 news filmed lord jenner outside his house in london on july 8 2014 , in what was is the most recent moving image of the labour peer . and in august , september , october and november , he did not miss a single sitting out of 32 days , and claimed £4,800 in expenses . yesterday david cameron said : ‘ i have enormous sympathy for anyone who has been the victim of crime or sexual abuse . ‘ but it is a very important principle that decisions about prosecutions are taken by independent authorities and we have to be very careful not to step over the line , however frustrating it may sometimes feel that people aren’t getting the justice that they deserve . ’ claims that janner was not fit to stand trial have been undermined by another case where a sex offender with dementia was brought to court . david massingham , 77 , was deemed not fit to stand trial on historic child abuse allegations because of his mental health but he was charged with 12 offences . he denied molesting two boys more than 30 years ago . a finding of fact hearing was held before a jury at teesside crown court in february last year . the jury decided massingham , of middlesbrough , had committed the acts . he was not found to be guilty , or not guilty , but a judge ordered he be detained indefinitely in hospital . peter saunders , of the national association for people abused in childhood , said the case proved what the authorities could have done over janner . he said : ‘ at the very least for the sake of victim survivors they should get that opportunity , to tell their truth before that kind of trial . ’ a procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness . in serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect’s absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes .
