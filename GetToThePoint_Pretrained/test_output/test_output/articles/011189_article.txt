' [ the inspiration was ] from my life . i wore high heels to work , to restaurants , to parties . ' i wore them everywhere but i could never manage the pain . once i nearly had a car accident when my heel locked under the break . ' i just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off , and that would go from a comfortable low-heel to a high-heel , and still make me look good ! ' tanya has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe , where the composition would n't change depending on the height of the heel . ' it took 14 engineers and two and a half years to perfect the arch and the clip . ' once we had a working principle , over 10 designers , shoe technicians and last specialists worked on creating styles that work in multi-height . ' her shoe collection has now become fully integrated with her own wardrobe . she has worn a style from the collection ' every day of my life for the past 3 years !
