' they go onto state : ' should henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter , those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this district . ' they point out : ' the colorado supreme court has said : `` killers can not receive life insurance proceeds from their victims '' and insurers can not disburse proceeds `` prematurely '' , ….when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending . ' the next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with dr bertolet , hayley . dr bertolet died on 29 september , 2012 . the autopsy report , dated 18 december 2012 , stated that she ' died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking . ' it concluded , ' homicide can not be excluded . ' but when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later , on september 27 , 2013 he gave her cause of death as ' accidental fall . ' at the time henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an fbi investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower 's life , culminating in his arrest last november . but despite facing murder charges henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife 's death . shockingly , not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense , documents filed in a separate motion in march show that he fought his late wife 's family to have funds from dr bertolet 's estate released into his possession . last february the district court of douglas county , colorado found in dr bertolet 's family 's favor and barred henthorn from accessing his late wife 's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an ' imminent risk of substantial harm..to [ its ] financial interests . ' both ‘ freak accidents’ occurred at remote locations with henthorn the lone witness . both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and henthorn , pictured here with his first wife , rishell , told wildly varying stories about both deaths . henthorn and lynn rishell when he was a new geology graduate from virginia . the couple moved to colorado , where after 12 years of marriage , she died in a ' freak accident ' , now said to be murder . henthorn ( left ) , pictured with grace ( center ) and lynn ( right ) rishell , was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $ 500,000 on the death of his first wife and $ 4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as december and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife 's estate . in march daily mail online revealed that , in 2009 henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law , grace rishell . grace was going through a divorce and ' concerned for her financial stability , ' when she initially agreed to henthorn 's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $ 50,000 to grace 's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $ 250,000 . according to prosecutors in dr bertolet 's murder case , ' the evidence will show that henthorn had a romantic interest in rishell . ' but she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through . instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer . yet unbeknownst to her , ' her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well , ' with henthorn making payments on the policy until december 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary . the policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that henthorn had no insurable interest in rishell . but the very fact of its existence raises the specter that henthorn had rishell in his sights as a third potential victim . henthorn was denied bail by us district attorney judge kathleen latoyfa who described him as a ' danger ' and said , ' there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second . ' she pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was ' hiding funds . ' henthorn 's trial is scheduled to begin in september . he has entered a plea of not guilty .
