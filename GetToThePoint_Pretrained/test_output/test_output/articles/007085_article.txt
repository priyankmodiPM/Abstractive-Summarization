kurt cobain , john lennon , freddie mercury . every rock band has a face . but what if they were seen as one ? in an unusual project by men 's face product company west coast shaving , each member of history 's most esteemed rock bands are blended into one . scroll down for video . the face of rock : the members of 30 legendary bands are blended into 30 single faces . some band members in particular shine through . at first glance , the photo for the beatles looks like a blurry picture of a young paul mccartney . kurt cobain is clearly visible in nirvana 's merged shot . and the features of eddie van halen dominate the image of van halen . john lennon ( second left ) is touted as the ' face ' of the beatles because he took the lead on many songs . but fans , and many others , will know ringo ( far left ) , george ( second right ) and paul ( right ) were equally pivotal . the rolling stones : these five faces are some of the most distinctive in the genre of rock . ireland 's rockers : with raspy vocals and a healthy helping of leather , u2 made waves in the rock world . red hot : the chilli peppers also earned a spot in the list of 30 top rock bands . the english rock movement : led zeppelin ( left ) and black sabbath ( right ) flew britain 's flag . guns n ' roses : beneath all that hair are five easily recognizable faces to rock fans . others not so much . u2 is a bizarre mix of the irish bunch , as is the rolling stones picture . and aside from a hint of billy joe armstrong 's eyeliner , green day also blend into something somewhat unrecognizable . publishing the project , west coast shaving wrote in ablog post : ' we wanted to include kiss with makeup , however the result was just a white and black mess . ' as for zz top , that image was simple a mashup of sunglasses and facial hair . '
