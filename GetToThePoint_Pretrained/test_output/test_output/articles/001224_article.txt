a canal bank beneath a busy flyover might not rank as paradise . but for this puzzled puffin – apparently suffering a navigation malfunction and pining for the atlantic – it was welcome sanctuary . the confused bird was seen swimming in the grand union canal earlier this month after apparently flying into london along the thames . this puzzled puffin was spotted flying into london along the thames , close to the a4 flyover at brentford . the distinctive bird with an orange beak was spotted by an eagle-eyed canal boat resident . the puffin was given some fish and wrapped in a blanket , before being handed to a specialist centre in dorset to recuperate . more commonly seen in iceland and the north atlantic , it was spotted near the a4 flyover at brentford . its holiday came to an end when a canal-boat resident caught sight of its distinctive beak and alerted the appropriate authorities . steve knight , of the swan sanctuary in nearby shepperton , caught the bird , which has now been handed over to a specialist centre in dorset , where he is being nursed back to full health . ‘i’ve never rescued a puffin before but these birds dive very quickly so you’ve got to be quick about it , ’ he said.‘ . ' all he knew about it was a big net coming over him and that was it . he looked pretty exhausted and hungry , and he seemed to have lost weight . the puffin was spotted swimming in the grand union canal ( left ) while the species normally reside in iceland . ' i gather they normally eat sand eels but there aren’t too many of them in the grand union , so we gave him some whitebait . ’ sanctuary founder dot beeson added she believes the puffin got lost or was blown off course by recent winds .
