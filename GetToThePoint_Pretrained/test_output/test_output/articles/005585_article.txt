ian gibson , a former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat and is suing his employer after a colleague nicknamed him hoppy . a former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat more than 30 years ago is suing his employer after he was nicknamed ' hoppy ' by a colleague . today , ex-army tank driver ian gibson from hillingdon in middlesex told an employment tribunal that he was subjected to a tirade of ' horrible harassment ' while working at h and g contracting services ltd at heathrow airport . the 60-year-old joined the company as plane refueller in december 2007 , three decades after he was medically discharged from the british army 's parachute regiment . his job involved kneeling down , removing a manhole cover and connecting the fuel pipe to refuel planes . in 2010 he underwent a knee replacement and had further surgery on his other knee two years later . mr gibson claims that bosses failed to make his job easier after the pain in his knee became too excruciating and was overlooked for an office-based job , which was instead offered to a man he said bullied him about being disabled . he told the tribunal in reading : ' i suffered bullying and harassment and discrimination as a result of my disability , in particular from mike baldwin who bullied me because of my disability and the way i walk . ' on my return to work there was no medical or risk assessment . i carried on the work without adjustments which caused further pain . ' mr gibson added that he was offered a temporary admin role in the workshop at the firm in november 2013 . however , when he lodged a grievance complaint about the bullying , he was told his admin job would not be made permanent . he also claimed he was not informed about a vacancy for a workshop/site service manager role when he was off work . he added : ' i feel the reason was because i lodged a grievance and was a hassle to the company . ' i think i was deliberately not informed of the position . mike baldwin told me he had already been offered the job before i was given an interview . ' he called me `` hoppy '' because of my limp . the way i walk has been a real difficulty for me . he said to me `` they could get a tart in for Â£16,000 to do your job , disabled or not so watch yourself '' . ' in april 2014 , he called me ' hoppy ' and said `` i do n't know why you joined the army , jumping out of planes for what ? this f****d up country , you must be f*****g stupid , look at you , it has left you with f***** up legs '' . ' mr gibson claimed he was subjected to the bullying and harassment while working at heathrow airport , pictured , for h and g contracting services ltd ( file picture ) . naomi cunningham , representing h and g contracting services ltd , challenged mr gibson asking him if the nickname was just ' harmless ' . but he added : ' to you it might be , to me it is n't i got a limp serving this country if you want to go down that route . ' my grandchildren do not like coming around as much as they used to call me grumpy granddad . ' miss cunningham also said the company might have had no reason to think mr gibson was suitable for the job of a site service manager due to a lack of experience and that the office-based job was always meant to be permanent . but the grandfather replied : ' there was scores missing from my cv . i had one night to do it , i had been with h and g for years . ' it was a temporary job but i was told to keep working hard and management will try and get it permanent for me . i was under that impression . '
