' in this country , since 2008 , since the great financial crash , we have had a difficult time . it has been hard for people and as a country together sacrifices have been made to get the country back on track . ' so i understand why people are thinking very carefully about how they vote - i just believe in the end and hope in the end they will stick with the people turning the economy around rather than go back to the people who crashed it in the first place . ' but in the end , we are a democracy , people will choose . ' mr cameron said he was left ' angry ' by labour attacks describing him and the conservatives as heartless . he told the itv programme : ' what i have done as prime minister is try to turn our economy around , get our country back on its feet . it was the poorest that were hit hardest by labour . ' i get very angry when i hear this attack because we have taken three million of the lowest paid people out of income tax , there are two million extra jobs - people who did n't have work now have work . ' the nhs is absolutely vital to me and is there for everyone 's family . labour can talk about this stuff but i remember what they did in office , i remember the people thrown out of work , who had their houses repossessed . ' it drives me mad sometimes now to hear them talk after five years of opposing everything we have done to get the economy back on track . ' my fear for the country is if they get back in again , they will do it all over again and wreck it . '
