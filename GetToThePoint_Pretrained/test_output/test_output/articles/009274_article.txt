a 4,000-year-old tree thought to be britain 's oldest living organism may be dying according to its custodian . the stunning ashbrittle yew , in the churchyard of the parish 's church of st john the baptist , in somerset , has a girth of 38ft and an enormous vast canopy . its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease - and locals fear it is on its way out due to wilting branches and falling leaves . the 4,000-year-old tree is ' looking extremely sick , ' according to a warden at the church in ashbrittle , somerset . churchwarden charles doble said : ' the tree is supposed to be the oldest living thing in england and was already fairly mature when stonehenge was being built . ' experts say it is 3,500 to 4,000 years old . ' but it 's looking extremely sick at the moment and i 'm worried whether the rural church or the yew will die first . ' but tree expert dr owen johnson said the yew , in the village 10 miles west of taunton , could just be going through a bad patch . he said : ' they go through spells where they might look as though they are not thriving , but a few years later they might look fine . ' the ashbrittle yew is the subject of myth and legend and people believe the mound it grows on is bronze age and that a pre-roman chief is buried there . the world 's oldest tree lives on a mountain in central sweden – and it is still growing . the 9,500-year-old norwegian spruce ( pictured right ) was discovered by scientists at umeå university during a 2004 tree census in fulufjällets national park in sweden . the age of the tree was established using carbon-14 dating at a laboratory in miami , florida after an investigation by the university . it has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation , which means it is able to effectively clone itself . while the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new , its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years .
