' it seems the relationship came to an end in 2013 . mr swarbrick commenced a relationship with miss coxhead . campbell was arrested in march 2014 over the matters relating to holman , but an examination of her personal ipad which was seized by officers revealed pictures of ms coxhead , leading to a further probe . campbell , her ex stuart swarbrick and his partner all worked for lancashire police ( headquarters pictured ) . mr lowe said : ' as a result of inquiries the defendant 's phone and ipad were seized and what 's particularly significant is there were a large number of photographs obtained of alice coxhead . ' there are deleted inquiries about her , relating to her daughter and her father' s funeral . ' all of this , the crown says , is reflective of the obsessive , irrational behaviour which drove this defendant to abuse the systems held by lancashire constabulary . ' mr lowe told the court checks revealed she had initially accessed the information about friend ms holman following an harassment dispute involving ms lyne . mr lowe said campbell had twice accessed information on her friend but added she may have done so out of ' some sort of misguided loyalty ' to holman . he added : ' the crown 's case is she had no business to do that . ' the jury heard campbell also accessed the computer system in august 2012 in relation to an alleged assault on ms lyne by a man named dean harrison . david temkin , defending , said : ' she did what she did in the first counts for a police purpose - the provision of information she says had been provided to her by her friend amanda holman . ' she wished to give details of her home address . she says she had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable . ' liverpool crown court ( pictured ) heard campbell denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material under the computer misuse act 1990 . he added campbell had not wanted to bump into or confront her ex or his new partner at work and wanted to ' just get on with her job ' . he said in the case of the third charge , the one in relation to the assault , she just wanted to check she would have no involvement in the assault case . he added : ' the actions she took were rational and sensible . ' on the remaining counts it is said she knew she was not authorised to access that data . ' she says she did n't know that at all , she had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable . ' giving evidence , dc les clegg , of lancashire police 's anti-corruption team , said text messages between holman and the defendant appeared to correspond to her accessing information about dean harrison . in a later message , holman had thanked her and indicated she would not be ' speaking to him ' - said by the crown to refer to dean harrison . the trial continues .   sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .
