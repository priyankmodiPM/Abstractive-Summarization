' however , matt gordon-smith said : ' the important point here is that this is in dedworth which formerly would n't have had such businesses coming here . ' surely places like costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of windsor is on the up ?
