franck ribery has dismissed reports linking wolfsburg forward kevin de bruyne with bayern munich as a potential replacement for the former france international or his team-mate arjen robben . de bruyne , who spent his two years at chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed bundesliga club , has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league 's assist charts with 16 – seven more than the next best . but ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under pep guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the holland winger . kevin de bruyne is linked with bayern munich as a potential replacement for the club 's veteran forwards . the wolfsburg playmaker , here in action for belgium against israel , has 16 assists and nine goals this season . bayern 's franck ribery says despite de bruyne 's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for munich . ' he is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him , ' ribery told german publication sport bild . ' de bruyne is great , when he fits the counterattack . at bayern , however , you usually only have three or four metres in front of you , not a lot of room . but he is a good player and he is still young , so he can still learn . ' ribery and robben 's contracts run out in 2017 and both have endured injuries worries of late prompting reports that an injection of youth such as 23-year-old de bruyne could be good for the club . ribery ( left ) says de bruyne 's counter-attacking skills do n't mesh with the style of pep guardiola ( right ) . ribery has struggled with injuries of late and has been linked with moves away from the bundesliga leaders . should bayern be in the market for a young attacker , however , ribery knows precisely who he 'd want to see at allianz arena – de bruyne 's belgian team-mate eden hazard . ' he attacks all of the time . he loves to run at his opponent , ' he said . ' but he plays at chelsea - this could be very expensive for bayern . ' if bayern do go for de bruyne , against their outspoken veteran 's advice , they 'll have competition from manchester city , who have met with his representatives , along with paris saint-germain . wolfsburg are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season 's champions league . chelsea 's eden hazard would be an ideal fit with guardiola and the allianz arena , says ribery , but expensive .
