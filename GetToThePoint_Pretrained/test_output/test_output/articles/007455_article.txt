french giants paris saint-germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that david luiz will miss the champions league clash with barcelona . the former chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against andre-pier gignac in the first-half of sunday’s game against rivals marseille . current french champions psg went on to win the game but the news of luiz’ injury came as a major worry . david luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays , but one such run led to his injury . the brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . and those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter-final tie with barcelona . laurent blanc’s side are still fighting for the ligue one title and could be forced to play eight matches without the 27-year-old . psg currently sit top of the pile in france just one point ahead of lyon in second . luiz limped off , and could now be a doubt for the champions league quarter-final against barcelona .
