' ' i knew this was a dangerous situation . i could n't leave her , but i could not go back to my house to get my phone . ' when a man emerged from the home , mr hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation . but the man then turned and fled , it is reported . mr hamilton added : ' this is where it could have taken a turn for the worse , ' said hamilton . ' he came out and he ran . he saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing . ' ' she was very emotionally distressed and she said , `` i 'm sorry i have to put you through this . '' there was nothing to apologize for . ' it 's just the right thing to do . we live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what 's going on around them . ' in part , he has thankful for having his dog , as he would n't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason . he told the toronto star : without having that dog , i would n't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood , and if he had n't taken a walk , he would n't have encountered a shocking crime in progress , and would n't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman 's life . ' whatever fate or destiny comes into it , the dog has as much of a part . ' the horror of what happened to her , of what she had gone through , had n't really sunk into me yet . ' what sinks into you is the horror you 're seeing right now , which is that there 's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help . ' after he contacted police , mr hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town . ' that was good . it calmed everybody down , ' he said . the woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering . crime scene : after mr hamilton helped free the woman , a man emerged from the house , so they ran . the alleged victim is now being treated in hospital .
