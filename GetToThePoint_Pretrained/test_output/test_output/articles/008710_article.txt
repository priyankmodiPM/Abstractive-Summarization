' the top four was our target at the start of the season , and that is still our target now , but we have to keep going .

' all of the top five or six clubs have some tricky games in the run-in . we all play each other at some point , too , and it will go to the last weekend for everybody . ' this is a really big game for both teams on saturday , with just four rounds of fixtures left in the season . ' it is a tough place to go , and saracens are a consistently good team who come into this weekend on the back of a european champions cup quarter-final win . ' but we 've come into some form , and we want to maintain that through to the end of the season and see where that takes us . '
