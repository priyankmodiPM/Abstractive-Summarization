lewis hamilton led the way in both practice sessions for sunday 's chinese grand prix . hamilton suggested mercedes will be back in control for this race after ferrari and sebastian vettel conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team 's first victory for almost two years at the last race in malaysia . many people expected another dominant mercedes campaign in the wake of last season 's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in australia . lewis hamilton was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend 's chinese grand prix . the briton , mobbed by fans in the paddock , is bidding to win his fourth chinese grand prix . 1 . lewis hamilton mercedes 1:37.219 . 2 . kimi raikkonen ferrari 1:37.662 . 3 . daniel ricciardo red bull - renault 1:38.311 . 4 . sebastian vettel ferrari 1:38.339 . 5 . nico rosberg mercedes 1:38.399 . 6 . daniil kvyat red bull - renault 1:38.737 . 7 . valtteri bottas williams-mercedes 1:38.850 . 8 . felipe nasr sauber - ferrari 1:39.032 . 9 . romain grosjean lotus - mercedes 1:39.142 . 10 . jenson button mclaren 1:39.275 . 11 . pastor maldonado lotus - mercedes 1:39.444 . 12 . fernando alonso mclaren 1:39.743 . 13 . marcus ericsson sauber - ferrari 1:39.751 . 14 . max verstappen toro rosso - renault 1:39.894 . 15 . carlos sainz jr toro rosso - renault 1:39.971 . 16 . nico hulkenberg force india - mercedes 1:40.151 . 17 . felipe massa williams-mercedes 1:40.423 . 18 . sergio perez force india - mercedes 1:40.868 . 19 . roberto merhi marussia - ferrari 1:42.973 . 20 . will stevens marussia - ferrari 1:44.564 . even mercedes motorsport boss toto wolff suggested ferrari 's success was ' a wake-up call ' to his organisation . without doubt mercedes , and hamilton in particular , responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate nico rosberg at the end of fp1 when pirelli 's medium-compound tyre was used . switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in fp2 , hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443secs over ferrari 's kimi raikkonen . red bull 's daniel ricciardo was third quickest , 1.093secs adrift , but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues . it is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate daniil kvyat 's day . as the young russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire , and although kvyat attempted to return , he was eventually forced to pull off track . felipe massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . the brazilian inspects his williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . vettel was fourth on the timesheet , 1.120secs down , with rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres . kvyat still ended up sixth , followed by the williams of valtteri bottas , sauber 's felipe nasr and romain grosjean in his lotus . mclaren 's jenson button completed the top 10 , two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement , with team-mate fernando alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace . felipe massa 's session , meanwhile , lasted 38 minutes as the williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in f1 . daniil kvyat 's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the red bull driver ended up in the gravel . fernando alonso looks on from the back of the mclaren garage ... he ended the second session in 12th . the brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14 , losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier . although massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car , the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre , forcing him to abandon . it resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car 's retrieval , with massa ultimately finishing down in 17th . manor duo roberto merhi and will stevens brought up the rear , the latter encountering issues with his power unit in fp2 which restricted him to just six laps . stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both australia and malaysia due to other difficulties . sebastian vettel , winner at the malaysian grand prix last time out , was fourth quickest in the second session .
