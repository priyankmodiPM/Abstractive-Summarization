if a homeless man stopped you on the street and offered you money , what would you do ? that is the question being posed in a new youtube video by entertainer yousef saleh erakat , who disguised himself as a homeless man and found out that the answer was often less than kind . as a man in a suit and on his cell phone walks by in the beginning of the video , erakat gets his attention . ' i just want to be a helping hand today , ' he says , offering the man a $ 10 bill . the man holds his money for a second , astounded , before throwing it at erakat . ' i do n't need your f***ing money , you a****** . i could f***ing buy you . ' youtube entertainer yousef saleh erakat disguised himself as a homeless man to see what would happen if he offered people on the street his own money instead - and found out the results were less than kind . erakat said he wanted to ' flip the script ' . throughout the video he appears in a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket , holding a cardboard sign that reads , ' no one has every become poor from giving ' . another man in a suit walks by , typing on his phone . ' i do n't have any money man , ' he says when he sees erakat . ‘ no i don’t need your money , i’m trying to give you money , ' erakat says . when the man says he doesn’t need erakat 's money the actor responds , ‘i’m just trying to help out today , here you go . ’ ‘ does it look like i need your money ? f***k out of here , ’ the man angrily replies , slapping his hand away before walking off . ' in today 's society it 's socially acceptable for the wealthy to give money to the homeless , ' erakat explains in the video , posted on his fouseytube channel . ' is it acceptable because it 's one individual helping another , or because one individual is better than the other - so it 's okay to help ? ' erakat said he wanted to ' flip the script ' . throughout the video he appears barefoot , wearing a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket . he holds a cardboard sign that reads , ' no one has ever become poor from giving . ' erakat said he wanted to find out if it was acceptable for the rich to give money to the poor because ' it 's one individual helping another , or because one individual is better than the the other - so it 's okay to help ? ' another man tells erakat to 'p*** off , mate , ' when he 's offered the $ 10 bill , and later a woman angrily asks him ' are you trying to be funny ? are you kidding me ? ' . one man stops and offers erakat his water bottle , saying he wants to help him out but it 's all he has to give give at the moment . but when erakat offers him money instead , he gets angry . ' you wan na give me money , man ? f**** you prick ! ' the man says as he gives the seemingly homeless man the finger and yet still taking the $ 10 bill . erakat 's most volatile reaction comes when he offers to pay for a man 's parking meter , showing him his cardboard sign . ' let me give you something . you see that , ' the man then asks , pointing to his white mercedes benz . ' that 's a benz - you got ta earn your way up , pal . ' after erakat tells the man that advice was the most pretentious thing he 's heard all day , the two begin yelling at each other as the man continues talking about carrying a black card and driving a $ 50,000 c-class car . ‘ it doesn't matter how much money you have , it doesn't matter what car you drive , it matters how humble you are in your heart , ' erakat says . ' and you’re not really humble saying all that , ’ he continues , to which the man just responds , ‘ this is la baby ! ’ when erakat tells one man he 's does n't need money , he 's just trying to ' help out today , ' the man ‘ does it look like i need your money ? f***k out of here , ’ slapping his hand away before walking off . erakat 's most volatile reaction came when he offered to pay for a man 's parking meter , showing him his cardboard sign . ' let me give you something . you see that , ' the man then asks , pointing to his white mercedes benz . ' that 's a benz - you got ta earn your way up , pal ' . only two people featured in the video listen to the seemingly homeless man 's offer and want to give him something in return . one man hands erakat back his $ 10 bill , adding some money of his own . ' i have all that i need too , ' the man tells him . when erakat asks , ' you 're going to give me all that ? ' the man responds , ' it 's a good message man , so positive ' . ' i know you 're in a rush , ' erakat says as he tries to grab the attention of one woman . when she responds that she does n't have any cash he tells her he 's actually ' trying to give you cash ' . ' no keep it , ' she says , walking towards him . ' you need it . ' ‘ look i’m broke as it is , the only way for me to feel rich in this world is by giving what i can , ' erakat responds . ' so here you go , ’ he says , reaching out to hand her the bill . only two people featured in the video listened to the seemingly homeless man 's offer and wanted to give him something in return . ‘ you know what ? i have a few dollars , ’ one woman told him , opening her wallet . ‘ why don’t you take more and make me feel rich for the day ? go get breakfast ! ' ‘ you know what ? i have a few dollars , ’ she then says , opening her wallet . ‘ why don’t you take more and make me feel rich for the day ? go get breakfast ! ’ erakat gives the woman her money back before she can walk off and tells her she’s on camera . ‘i’m not trying to see who will give me money or who would not , ’ he tells her . ‘ but i’m just showing that the only thing they have in this world is to give to others . ’ erakat , whose youtube channel has more than 5million subscribers , says the point of the video was n't to see ' if people would offer us money ' . instead , the vlogger wanted to discover ' how people feel about themselves when someone who is classified as `` lesser '' than them on society 's class ladder offers them money '' . he admits in the youtube description that the results were ' not expected and not wanted ' . ' it does n't matter how much you have in life if what you have in life takes away from you being humble , ' he writes . ' at the end of the day , even the most poor man can be the most rich depending on how much love he has in his heart . '
