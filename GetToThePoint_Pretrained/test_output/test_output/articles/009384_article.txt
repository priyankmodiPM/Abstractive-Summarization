' his wife added : ' since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again , we do n't want to get out of bed and carry on . ' we feel like we lost our little boy for nothing . ' he was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came , it all happened so fast . i could n't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever . ' i saw things no one should ever see . i know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs . ' in a moving statement , she earlier described the impact on her family of freddie 's death , and said : ' we have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother , his best friend and playmate and can not comprehend how or why this has happened . ' archie does n't want to watch cartoons on saturday morning any more , as this is something he used to do with freddie . ' it is devastating as a parent when you have already lost one child and your other one talks about killing himself so he can be with his brother . he is only eight years old . what can you do or say ? ' archie and i have started therapy . i get flashbacks of the incident and events before and after every day . i have woken up at night screaming as i relive what happened in my dreams and it is terrifying .
