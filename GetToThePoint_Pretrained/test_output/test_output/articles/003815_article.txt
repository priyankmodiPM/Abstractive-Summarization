chelsea goalkeeper thibault courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks . the belgian was exceptional for the blues in their win over queens park rangers on sunday . it was a far cry from his displays in chelsea 's previous two matches , however . thibaut courtois ( centre ) was in phenomenal form as chelsea beat rivals queens park rangers on sunday . courtois ( centre ) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a goal for hull on march 22 . courtois cut a despondent man against hull ( left ) but was back on form against qpr on sundat . his poor touch allowed abel hernandez to score in chelsea 's 3-2 win over hull on march 22 before stoke 's charlie adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend . but courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result . ' i never doubted that i ca n't catch the ball . against hull , i just tried to make the best solution , ' he said . ' it was not the best control , but in the second half i showed that i am mentally strong and i saved the team . ' against stoke , if you want to play high as a team , you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well . charlie adam did a good strike and that can happen . ' but i showed against qpr that if you play high , you can go get the ball from the midfield . if i 'm on the 16 yard box , i can go get it there . for me it 's not a problem . courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out charlie adam 's 66-yard strike against stoke . courtois ( right ) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for chelsea . ' i continue . i never doubt myself . that 's my strength . i helped the team with two good saves against qpr and i 'm happy . ' the most important thing is the team and against hull and stoke we still won . ' i 'm 22 and still learning . these were moments which i could learn from . '
