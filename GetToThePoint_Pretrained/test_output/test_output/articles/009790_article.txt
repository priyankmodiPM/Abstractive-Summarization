' she said : ' some of the things that have been printed i have actually said but not in that context ... it 's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way .

' janet street porter , 68 , then said : ' i was completely in agreement with jamelia and i said you 've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25 , can she run around with her children , can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later ?

' speaking on loose women yesterday , in the conversation which sparked the controversy , jamelia said : ' i do not think it 's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle , in the same way i do n't believe that a size zero should be available - it 's not a healthy size for an average woman to be .
