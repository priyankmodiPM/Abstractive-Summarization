a part-time worker had the shock of her life after she was ordered to pay more three quadrillion pounds in pension contributions . the blunder at the pensions office in essen , in the north rhine-westphalia area of germany saw a letter sent out the woman asking for £3,351,978,728,190,661 . the bill is more than a thousands times than the whole of germany 's annual gross domestic product . how much is one quadrillion ? this graphic shows what one quadrillion pennies would look like stacked on top of each other . the block would dwarf the burj khalifa in dubai , the empire state building and london 's shard . the £3.35 billion is also enough to pay the uk government debt nearly 2,000 times over . in fact , the customer 's real contributions should only have been around a few hundred pounds . a quadrillion , is a thousand times one trillion , ( a million times a million ) in the american system . so a quadrillion is ten to the power of 15 or 1,000,000,000,000,000 . in the british system , one quadrillion is ten to the power of 24 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 . however , in most english speaking countries , including the uk , the american system is the accepted . a spokesman for the office said the mistake was made when a pensions office worker accidentally copied a customer number into the form , rather than the amount outstanding . ' yes , the letter did in fact go out like that , ' pensions office spokesman wolfgang buschfort confirmed to the local on wednesday . ' as far as i know , this is the only time anyone has been called on to make such a large incorrect payment . the error was spotted before the office attempted to debit the massive sum from the bank account of the woman , from the schwarzwald in baden-württemberg . mr buschfort added that with 26,000 employees working at the pensions office , mistakes were inevitable . the only evidence of the blunder that remained was the eye watering 16 figure demand letter . a part-time worker had the shock of her life after she was ordered to pay more three quadrillion pounds in pension contributions .
