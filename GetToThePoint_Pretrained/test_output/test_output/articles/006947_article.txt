europe has been urged to copy australia 's military-led ' stop the boats ' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the mediterranean . australian pm tony abbott – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach australia – said the eu should ' urgently ' follow his lead . his hardline policy has proved controversial but mr abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on saturday night . hardline : tony abbott , whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach australia , said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . haunted : surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the mediterranean sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the sicilian port city of catania yesterday morning . solemn : a young man , bows his head as he makes the short walk from the rescue boat 's deck to the catania shore where hundreds of people had gathered . new life : members of the italian police look on as a migrant who survived the ship sinking off the coast of libya walks the ramp of an italian coast guard 's vessel upon arrival at catania 's port yesterday morning . he said : ' the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats . ' that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the mediterranean . ' conservative mr abbott won power in 2013 on a ' stop the boats ' pledge , and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months . operation sovereign borders involves the australian navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea , and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from . mr abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the united nations over australia 's obligations to refugees , saying his policy was the ' most decent , most compassionate ' solution . in the mediterranean , callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by european nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back . last year , italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives . but the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions . eu leaders including david cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a ' life or death ' summit to solve the problem . save the children warned that 2,500 youngsters could die in the mediterranean this year . chief executive justin forsyth said : ' eu leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet . ' with every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations , the risk grows that more people will die .

' we 've got to start in the upstream countries . we 've got to deal with the traffickers , ' he said , adding he ' absolutely ' supported a ' more formidable operation on the sea ' . ed miliband said the government 's policy of ' leaving people to drown ' had been ' wrong ' . the labour leader said : ' frankly i think it is a stain on europe to have these things happening . ' we 've got to act on search and rescue , and that is about basic humanity and i think that people all around the country will recognise this . ' london mayor boris johnson said britain had a ' moral duty ' to do more . ' i think it is an absolute tragedy and obviously we must do whatever we can to help the humanitarian response , ' he said . one of the architects of australia 's tough border policies , retired army major-general jim molan , said european leaders were guilty of ' incompetence ' . mr molan said the tragedies were ' worsened by europe 's refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems ' . in the mediterranean , the tide of human misery has only worsened . saturday 's disaster was the most catastrophic in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year – 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 . in the past week alone , more than 1,000 have died . border chiefs have warned that one million migrants are waiting to set sail off the coast of libya , with the need for drastic action to address the crisis greater than ever before . malta 's prime minister joseph muscat has warned of a ' genocide ' and said : ' europe will be judged harshly for its inaction .
