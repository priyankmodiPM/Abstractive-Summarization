' i just thought nothing of it and when i went to the gp , i was told that there was nothing to worry about . ' when the doctor says `` do n't worry , you 're going to be just fine '' , you believe them , do n't you ? ' but by december , she had developed other symptoms and was given creams and anti-inflammatory drugs to deal with chest pain , night sweats and an all-over body rash . after her devastating diagnosis at the royal liverpool hospital , miss addison underwent a six-month course of chemotherapy to rid herself of the disease , which affects around 1,900 people each year . the treatment not only left her drained , but triggered septicemia and a blood clot . ' i lost a lot of muscle and i was so drained all the time , ' she recalled . ' i was so tired and in so much pain that i could barely stand up . ' even though i was only 23 , i felt like i had the body of a 90-year-old . ' despite her diagnosis - and starting chemotherapy almost instantly - she began a new job just days later , as planned . she also froze her eggs just in case the treatment rendered her infertile . to her relief , she was given the all-clear last september . and despite her harrowing experience , miss addison insists she would face cancer again if given the option . she said : ' it 's indescribable how happy i was to get the all-clear - i 've never felt happiness like it . ' my mum was the happiest person in the room when i heard the news . all of my family were so proud of me for getting through it . ' she also believe she has a better perspective in life after beating cancer . ' the lessons i learnt from it have made me much more appreciative of what i have in life and i feel like i 'm oddly lucky . ' she is now planning to celebrate by running the race for life in her hometown in july .
