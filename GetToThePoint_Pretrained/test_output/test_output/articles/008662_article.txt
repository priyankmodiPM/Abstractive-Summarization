' i should n't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community . while not holding you responsible for that , you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals . ' the intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals . i am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time . ' each of you has an unhealthy interest . you have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially darren wheatcroft - to make money out of it , involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals . you were involved in criminality .

' we 've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly . ' an rspca spokesman added : ' after fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet , dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic . often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds . ' most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring , die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners .
