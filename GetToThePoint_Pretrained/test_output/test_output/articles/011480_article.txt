' george osborne and david cameron do it because they want to . ’ mr cameron retorted : ‘ i defend all our decisions – you have a pick-and-mix approach . ’ miss sturgeon forced milband to suggest that labour is not now committed to plans to find another £30billion through tax rises and spending cuts , which he voted for earlier this year . the seven leaders in the tv debate : natalie bennett ( green ) , nick clegg ( lib dem ) , nigel farage ( ukip ) , ed miliband ( labour ) , leanne wood ( plaid cymru ) , nicola sturgeon ( snp ) and david cameron ( conservative ) . cameron heckler is thrown out . a female heckler was removed from the debate audience after she interrupted the prime minister . victoria prosser , 33 , said that she wanted to challenge the ‘1 per cent at the top’ . as david cameron tried to answer a question , the self-described ‘ wellbeing guru’ , who was dressed in a sheepskin-style gilet , stood up and heckled . she called out : ‘there’s homeless people on the streets that have been in the services . ’ debate moderator julie etchingham tried to stop the woman , telling her : ‘ not from the audience thank you . ’ ' i 'm sorry ' : as david cameron tried to answer a question victoria prosser , 33 , stood up and heckled him about homeless people who had served in the armed forces . but she continued : ‘ i have to speak out because i’m worried . at the end of the day there’s more of us than them and they’re not listening to us . ’ mr cameron replied : ‘ the lady makes an important point that there are people who come out of our armed services who have difficulties and that’s why we should be putting money into armed forces charities that help homeless people . ’ during his response , she could be heard shouting : ‘it’s not the truth . ’ she was then forcibly removed from the tv studio . on her twitter account she describes herself as ‘ mum , coach , artist , wellbeing guru ! ’ she has previously re-tweeted negative posts about ukip and mr cameron . according to her internet profiles , she volunteers at a homeless project in manchester as well as working at a vegetarian cafe in salford . outside the studio , miss prosser said she had been ‘ emotionally moved by david cameron using vulnerable people’ . she added : ‘ i can’t vote for anyone who i know is lying or omitting facts . that means i couldn’t vote for any of the people that i saw tonight . ’ ed miliband sent an aide to manchester to pick up two pairs of shoes for last night’s debate . the labour leader’s assistant was despatched to clark’s on market street in manchester to pick up two pairs of classic black shoes . she bought the francis air and glenrise walk brands , each priced at £65 . the revelation that mr miliband bought two pairs of shoes for one debate will add to claims he is indecisive , and comes just weeks after it emerged his house has two kitchens . clark’s assistant laura roberts , 22 , said : ‘ i helped his aide pick the two choices . they are two of our best-sellers . i’ll be watching to see which one he chooses . ’
