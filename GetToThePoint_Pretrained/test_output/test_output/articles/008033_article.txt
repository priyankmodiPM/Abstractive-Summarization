technology may have advanced in leaps and bounds , but when it comes to our most precious papers , it turns out many of us remain creatures of habit . a third of adults shun the storage possibilities of the internet and still keep their most important papers in a shoebox , a poll has found . ten per cent are even more relaxed about treasured photos , letters and mementos â€“ leaving them lying around in piles of paperwork . a third of adults shun the storage possibilities of the internet and still keep their most important papers in a shoebox , the poll by online file-sharing service lifetile found . from a marriage certificate to deeds to a house , only six per cent keep a back-up copy of vital paperwork online , while just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer , the poll by online file-sharing service lifetile found . the survey of more than 2,000 britons found almost half ( 45 per cent ) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents , from personal to official ones . while 32 per cent keep their possessions in a shoebox , the box itself is then filed away to a loft , cupboard or garage . the contents can include love letters and old photos before the age of digital cameras to a will or deeds to property , for instance , the children 's old school reports and mementos . the survey also found 10 per cent of brits ignore all the other available options and simply keep physical documents stacked in piles at various places around the home . an ultra cautious 4 per cent have safety deposit boxes , said the survey . lifetile is a service offering an online site to keep private documents , photos and other memories to build up a family history to share with children and others online . it allows users to import digital photos , social media updates and entries and uploaded paperwork . men are almost twice as likely women to keep such documents either online or on a computer , and younger adults more likely than older ones to do so , the research showed . just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer , while almost half ( 45 per cent ) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents . founder richard grant said : ' the old shoebox represents a comforting place for people to keep their important documents and treasured memories . ' they can return time and again to look at photos of their children growing up , love letters , marriage certificates and much more . ' it 's the story of your life in its simplest form . but the internet has opened up the possibility of immortalising our life story , by making it digital . ' it is harder to lose documents and memories kept online , easier to share them with others and easier to find them in a hurry than if they were stored out of the way at home . grant added : ' we spend so much of our life online , using the web to learn , shop and socialise and yet when it comes to the big life events and our important documents , all of which define us , we often choose to keep them tucked away for a rainy day .
