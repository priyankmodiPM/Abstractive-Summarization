' there were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff , but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk . ' this was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event ; an invitation to continue presenting the world 's biggest tv show for – let 's not be shy – a handsome salary . ' the three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting ' with dignity ' until clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer oisin tymon ( pictured ) . on the future , he remained vague , suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions . now , may admits ordering a brand new ferrari is a ' strange ' thing for an unemployed person to do , but insists he has no regrets , describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity . he acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that ' it was better than money in the bank ' . meanwhile , clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in london . elsewhere , hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be ' exciting ' for the three men , but refused to speculate further on the future of top gear . he said : ' everybody knows what 's happened . that 's all been in the news . the future , nobody knows yet do they ? ' and i can not and wo n't speculate further than that . so do n't know , let 's see . it 'll be exciting whatever . ' there is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by netflix , amazon or another british broadcaster . producer olsin tymon had his lip split by clarkson in the march 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries . police investigated the attack but tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would ' not be pursuing the matter any further . ' james may ( right ) was vague on the future for the trio , hinting that they may be reunited on screen .
