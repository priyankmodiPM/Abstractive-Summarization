' as well , knowing jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible . ' ms greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years . ' it took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and i wanted to fight - life is so precious , ' she said .
