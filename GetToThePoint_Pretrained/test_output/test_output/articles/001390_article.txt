' the movie ‘ american sniper’ is not about a racist mass murderer or a criminal , ' the petition read . ' it is about a decorated american war hero who served his country valiantly . ' if the university prevents a movie like this from being shown , it promotes intolerance and stifles dialogue and debate on the subject…as adults at a public university , we should have the option to view this movie if we so choose and have the opportunity to engage on the topics it presents to come to our own conclusions on the subjects . ' the school 's head football coach responded to the movie kerfuffle by tweeting that his team would watch the film . ' proud of chris kyle & proud to be an american & if that offends anybody then so be it !
