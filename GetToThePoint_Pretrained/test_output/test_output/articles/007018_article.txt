the house has gone . his ruin is complete and he must accept the whole responsibility for it . ’ sentencing , judge richard mansell qc told doyle he had ‘ barefaced gall’ to claim benefits and added : ‘i’m quite satisfied that you played a lead role in all of your offences . ‘ you had close links to the original sources of the drugs and you directed and organised the sale of drugs on a commercial scale . you plainly did make a lot of money from these enterprises - where it has gone is another matter . ’ he described doyle as ‘ the head of an organised criminal gang’ , who continued to orchestrate the business from behind bars because he had ‘ loyal servants working on the outside’ .
