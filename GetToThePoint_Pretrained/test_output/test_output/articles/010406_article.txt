' someone else has to get her a drink as she 's too small to reach taps by herself . ' and buying fashionable clothes is tough because she still wears clothes for a five-year-old . hayley , who turned 17 on december 3 , left school last summer . however , despite pioneering drug treatment in the us that gave her a new lease of life , she was unable to conquer the disease . her health deteriorated and she contracted pneumonia , and died at home on april 2 . her death was announced on april 3 when her mother kerry posted on facebook : ' my baby girl has gone somewhere better . she took her last breath in my arms at 9.39pm x .

' but as i 'm only 5ft 4ins i tried to tell myself she simply took after me . ' hayley and her family fundraised for her medical treatment and to raise public understanding of the condition . at 13 months , hayley still wore clothes for a three-month-old , so her mother took her to their gp . tests revealed she had a rare gene mutation called hutchinson-gilford progeria . next came the devastating news that hayley would only live until the age of 13 . determined to make the most of the time she had , the family embarked on giving hayley amazing memories . members of the local community raised thousands of pounds to pay for her to go to disneyland in california . in her short life , hayley went swimming with dolphins , travelled all over the world , met prince charles , kylie minogue and justin bieber and starred in several tv documentaries . despite her terrible prognosis , the teenager remained upbeat . ' in many ways i feel i 've been lucky . because of this i 've met more people and done more than many do in a lifetime , ' she said .
