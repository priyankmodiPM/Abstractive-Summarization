the monkeys of northern india 's shimla region have a fearsome reputation - and as this video shows , for a very good reason . a teenager in the area has discovered the hard way that the locals should not be toyed with after his affront to a monkey left him sprawled on his back . footage captured on a cctv camera near an office in shimla , india , shows the playful monkey first jumping onto a ledge to watch pedestrians wander past . scroll down for video . the teenager wanders past the monkey , who eyeballs him from a ledge as he gives it the middle finger . much like a human , the monkey interprets the gesture as an insult and responds by throwing himself at the teenager . catching the teenager off guard , it lands with its feet directly in his face . he is sent sprawling onto the ground , while the monkey quickly bounds back up again to the ledge . it is then the monkey finds himself in a stare down with the young man - who rather cheekily , gives it the middle finger believing it will do no harm . what he did n't anticipate was the monkey rearing its tail , bearing its fangs and launching itself at his face - taking him by surprise and sending him sprawling onto his back . although he walked away from the incident unharmed , he sat in a state of shock for several moments while the monkey returned to his perch . those familiar with the shimla region will be unsurprised - the monkeys of the area have a terrifying reputation . they are known to roam about in gangs , stealing tourists ' food and rummaging through bags and even peoples ' pockets in order to take valuables such as phones and cameras . monkey bites across the area are common and in some instances , they have caused deaths when people attempting to flee them have fallen from heights . the monkeys of the shimla region , such as the one featured in this video , have a reputation for aggression .
