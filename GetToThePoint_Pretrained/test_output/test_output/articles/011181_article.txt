' it went with the little ships and was initially going to be used as a fire boat but the strafing and gun fire was too much . ' because it has a shallow hull it was able to get into la penne beach outside dunkirk where she rescued 500 troops in three trips across the english channel and another 100 back to the uk after that . ' it did n't stop there because as the massey shaw headed home a french merchant ship hit a mine about two miles ahead of her . the massey went to the aid of the aid and the crew and rescued them as well from the water . controls : volunteers who restored the boat praised the quality of its 80-year-old engineering which still propels the boat . journey : a charity needs to raise £10,000 so they can afford the fuel needed to take the massey shaw back to dunkirk this year . repairs : the engine being removed from the interior of the boat while restoration works were going on . commemoration : the vessel boasts a plaque marking its historic status as one of the dunkirk ' little ships ' .

' the veteran firefighter , who spent 30 years with the london fire brigade , paid tribute to massey shaw 's unique survival . ' there is nothing like it left from the 1930s , she is a beautiful ship and the engineering is something to behold , ' he said . the trust is seeking at least £10,000 to pay for the fuel which would be needed to transport the boat from britain to dunkirk . after nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , the british expeditionary force ( bef ) was sent to help defend france . but in may 1940 , three german panzer corps attacked france through the ardennes and quickly advanced to the english channel . by may 21 , the german forces had trapped the bef and the remains of the french and belgian armies in an area along the northern coast of france . the british force retreated to dunkirk as it was the best site for an evacuation and the battle of dunkirk raged between may 26 and june 4 1940 . however , in one of the most bizarre military manoeuvres of the war , the nazis halted their final advance - this gave the allies three days to plan their escape and arrange the evacuation of 330,000 troops . escape : soldiers are pictured queuing up waiting to be rescued from dunkirk during operation dynamo . naval bosses ordered all owners of boats between 30ft and 100ft to offer them up to the admiralty , as the navy did not have enough vessels to transport all the troops itself . many of these little ships - which included ferries , paddle steamers and yachts - were taken without their owners ' permission because there was no time to contact them . a total of 700 vessels were joined by 200 warships and proceeded to cross the channel to rescue troops who would otherwise have faced potential disaster at the hands of the nazis . the mission , codenamed operation dynamo , was one of the most extraordinary moments of the war , and allowed the british authorities to rebuild their military strength . up to 500 little ships are believed still to be in existence , and they regularly travel back to dunkirk in flotilla to recreate the extraordinary operation .
