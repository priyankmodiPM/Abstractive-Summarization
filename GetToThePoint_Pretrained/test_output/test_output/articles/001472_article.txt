the inquiry into the iraq war , lead by sir john chilcot , began in 2009 , stopped taking evidence in 2011 , but will not report until 2016 , a source said . the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year . further delays to sir john chilcot’s inquiry into the war were reported by bbc’s newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news . it was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for labour . but it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry , which began in 2009 , will not be published until 2016 . newsnight’s diplomatic editor , mark urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016 . tony blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion . the former pm has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry . earlier this year , he apeared rattled when journalists put to him david cameron’s claim , that labour had got the publication delayed . he pointed to a statement released by his office which said : ‘ it is not true to say that tony blair has caused the delay in the report’s publication’ . mr blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised . every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them , often running to hundreds of pages . the inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses . the publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures , including tony blair , but will likely not report until even later .
