' thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies , we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller . ' i want to reassure our communities that the north west counter terrorism unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the ' dark web ' . law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity . ' i would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing . security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it . ' as in this case , the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the ' dark web ' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options .
