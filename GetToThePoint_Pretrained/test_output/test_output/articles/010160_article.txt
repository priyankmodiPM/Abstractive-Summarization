larry upright hated hillary so much she made it into his obituary . a north carolina man 's obituary asked two things of friends and family : instead of sending flowers for the funeral , give the money to charity . and do n't vote for hillary rodham clinton in 2016 . the family of 81-year-old larry upright added the political message to the obituary announcing the kannapolis man 's death and burial this week . upright 's daughter , jill mclain , said the rock-ribbed republican was passionate about politics . she says that recollection prompted his family to ask obituary readers to reject clinton 's presidential bid , not necessarily to spark controversy . ' we did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad , ' jill mclain told wsoc-tv . mike upright said his deceased father voiced his opinions regularly . ' we did this for him , ' mike upright said . ' we know he 's up there giggling right now . just laughing out loud . ' the obituary also describes upright as an active member of local masonic and shriners organizations and a country club . he retired after a career in the building automation industry . for their dad : ' we did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad , ' said his daughter jill mclain . meanwhile , a group of nevada sex workers have come out in favor of the democratic contender . the group , calling themselves hookers for hillary , all work at dennis hof 's infamous moonlite bunny ranch in carson city . the legal brothel , which was the subject of hbo 's cathouse series , has drafted a four-point platform explaining their endorsement . ' the bunny ranch entertains customers from all around the globe , and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will . '
