' once a friend adds a clip to a video , a user 's friendâ€™s friends will also be shown the video in riff and will be able to add to it . ' the potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially from there , so a short video can become an inventive project between circles of friends that you can share to facebook , or anywhere on the internet , at any time , ' continued the blog post . if it is a hoax then it is an elaborate one that facebook has continued for longer than april fool 's day .
