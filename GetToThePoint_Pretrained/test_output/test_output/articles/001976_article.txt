lada niva 4x4 £13,395 on the road . as a result of the land rover defender 's demise , there could be a boom in sales of a russian badge which was a butt of many jokes in the soviet era – the lada . lada 's 4x4 niva has long been the car that bucked the trend of laughing at the russian carmaker and has won fans around the world thanks to its robust nature and chunky looks . we take a look . the niva ( pictured ) is a highly capable , ruftytufty 4x4 from russia — for a fraction of the price of a new land rover and it is also available in a compact van format ( £10,590 , excluding vat and road tax ) . good . forget luxuries because the niva is an unabashed frills-free zone , the upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior ( pictured ) is easy to mop down after a day in the mud . bad . patriotic russian president vladimir putin ( pictured ) drove a lada niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a german engine .
