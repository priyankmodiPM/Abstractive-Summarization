' in my lifetime i have had occasion to run into a lot of homeless people , but i do n't recall ever meeting face-to-face a hopeless person . to me , someone who would give up on freedom , it was just shocking , ' murray said . potchen had decided he needed to go back to prison after his years free had left him without a job or a place to stay and sleeping in mosquito-filled woods . after stealing roughly $ 1,000 with a bank robbery note on the back of his resume , he sat on the curb outside and waited for police . potchen had lost his job , lost his place to stay and spent a night in the woods before deciding to rob a bank in indiana with a note on the back of his resume . the ex-con spent 12 and a half years in prison ( pictured ) and said that he wanted to go back after hitting rock bottom during his parole last year . the judge decided to let potchen withdraw his plea and give the 53-year-old a conversion charge that will drop the robbery charge if he stays out of trouble for one year . 'you’re not a throwaway , mr. potchen . you have value , sir . i’m always optimistic and hopeful that there are still good people out there who believe freedom is important , ' murray said in february . murray appealed to those who heard about the case to offer the defendant help . now the reformed man has reconnected with cousins who have bought him a microwave , clothes and a coffee maker to help him adjust to life on the outside and continue working welding truck flat beds in illinois . ' i ca n't stop them . they keep buying me things , ' he said . the owner of the trucking company , a devout christian , has hired ex-convicts before and felt like he needed to do something to help potchen . he said he was ' all about the job ' .
