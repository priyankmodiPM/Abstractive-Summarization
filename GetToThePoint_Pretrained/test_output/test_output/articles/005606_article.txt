anyone who had sat through arsenal v chelsea earlier on sunday . both sides flew forward from the off and their ambition was rewarded though for real madrid the reward was ultimately far greater . they fell behind after nine minutes when former barcelona player nolito took advantage of poor real madrid defending . sergio ramos lost his boot and was reduced to running back towards goal with it in his hand . and without him rafael varane , alvaro carvajal and asier illaramendi all failed to stop nolito as he tricked his way in from the left-hand channel and shot past iker casillas . real madrid responded on the quarter-hour when cristiano ronaldo crossed from the right . the ball was cleared straight to toni kroos who picked his spot well to fire madrid level with his second goal of

every sense and sergio ramos and joaquin larrivey both needed lengthy treatment after a clash of heads . ronaldo was linking well with james rodriguez and hernandez and almost put real ahead but saw his shot come back off the post after another fine pass from chicharito . when the goal that put real madrid ahead did come it was again made by ronaldo . he played in james rodriguez and his deflected shot beat alvarez to leave celta vigo going down the tunnel at half time stunned to have played so well in attack and yet still find themselves behind . their front three of ex-barça b forward nolito , journeyman centre-forward larrivey and teenage prospect mina , aided by orellana , had run real’s back four ragged and they kept the pressure up in the second half . it was orellana who wend down under a challenge from behind from kroos at the start of the second half but the referee was unmoved by the home side’s appeals . isco went close for real madrid and then ronaldo raced away on another counter-attack , which ended with a pass to hernandez , he tried to hit the shot first time and , falling as he made contact , blasted it high and wide . he would get another chance however and this time he would take it . celta were playing football that made a mockery of the financial gulf between the two sides . their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m real pay ronaldo but they were inevitable leaving themselves wide open on the counter and they were also tiring badly . it was perhaps the fatigue that meant they allowed sergio ramos to bring the ball out from the back without a celta player anywhere near him . ramos picked out hernandez with a long pass forward and he controlled it with his first touch before slotting past alvarez with an emphatic second . a week ago he was a frustrated squad player . now with the season approaching its climax he looks like one of real madrid 's most important players .
