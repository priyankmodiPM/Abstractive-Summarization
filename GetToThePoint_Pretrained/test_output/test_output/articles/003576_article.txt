' labour 's shadow education secretary tristram hunt dismissed the proposal as ' desperate ' . labour 's shadow education secretary tristram hunt said dismissed the announcement as a ' a desperate attempt by the tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards ' . mr hunt said : ' on their watch , 1.6 million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than ' good ' by ofsted . and as a result of david cameron 's unqualified teachers policy , more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers . ' labour has a better plan for education . we will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new master teacher status to raise the standing of the profession . that is how we improve education for every child , in every classroom , ' he said . the lib dem schools minister david laws said the tories had ' no credibility ' on education because of their planned spending cuts after the election . he said : ' you simply ca n't improve schools by starving them of resources and burdening them with the bureaucracy of additional testing . ' the way to make sure every child starts secondary school achieving a good level of maths and english is to invest in their early years and primary education , recruiting great teachers and getting extra support to the children who most need it . ' that 's why we need to protect the education budget , in real terms , including schools , nurseries and colleges . ' the tories are trying to paper over the cracks in their scorched earth education plans that would undo the progress of the last five years . ' malcolm trobe , deputy general secretary of the association of school and college leaders union , warned the tests could become a bureaucratic nightmare . he said : ' it is important that the results of these tests are diagnostic and used to support the work of the teachers and do not become yet another performance indicator on which to measure schools .
