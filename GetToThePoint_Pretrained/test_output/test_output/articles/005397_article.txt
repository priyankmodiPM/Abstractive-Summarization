' we want to give daisy as normal a life as possible and give her the same opportunities as other children . ' anophthalmia is a rare disease in which a baby is born with no eyes . it develops during pregnancy , and affects around one in 10,000 births in the uk . there is sadly no cure . ms davis said : ' the cyst showed up on the 21-week scan and naturally , we were worried about it . anophthalmia means an absence of the eye . a child may be born with one , or both eyes , missing from the eye socket . the rare disorder develops during pregnancy and can be associated with other birth defects . the condition may be caused by genetic mutations and abnormal chromosomes . researchers also believe that environmental factors , such as exposure to x-rays , chemicals , drugs , pesticides , toxins , radiation , or viruses , increase the risk of anophthalmia , but research is not conclusive . unfortunately , there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by anophthalmia . children will need to undergo repeated hospital visits and many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance . source : the micro and anopthalmic children 's society .
