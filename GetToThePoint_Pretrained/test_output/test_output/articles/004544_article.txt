sending post to space is problematic , so when a teenager from houston , texas , wanted to send a message to her astronaut father , she had to be creative . 13-year-old stephanie decided that long-distance phone calls were n't enough and she wanted to given her father a visual note of how much she missed him while he was away . the next time the nasa employee was up in space , she decided to create a huge art project in the desert that he would be able to see from the international space station . the message 13-year-old stephanie wrote to her father in nevada’s delamar dry lake . her father is a keen photographer and likes to take pictures of the earth when he is floating in space . stephanie thought she could use his hobby to send him a message from back on earth . she enlisted the help of car manufacturer hyundai to make the earth drawing , that has now broken a world record for its size . the car company used eleven sedans to draw the message on the land in nevada’s delamar dry lake , that read ‘ steph [ hearts ] you ! ’ using coordinates and a helicopter . stephanie drew the note on paper and worked with hyundai to get it copied onto a large land surface . 11 cars wrote the message in the dusty land in nevada’s delamar dry lake using coordinates and a helicopter . her father took a picture of the image from space to show his daughter that her plan had worked . measuring 5,556,411.86 square metres or 59,808,480.26 square feet , the guinness world record has now declared it the largest tire track image ever . the scheme has been made into a video for hyundai’s new thinking campaign . stephanie 's father taking pictures of the message from the international space station . the picture of the message on stephanie 's father 's phone .
