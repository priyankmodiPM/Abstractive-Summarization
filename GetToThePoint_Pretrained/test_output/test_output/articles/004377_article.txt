' by lunchtime there was a brisk wind , blowing in strong gusts that suggested a storm might be coming . ' overhead the skies were bright blue , almost cloudless and full of promise . ' i did n't know it at the time , but ella had bought slimming tablets on the internet . the substance in the pills ella took is unsuitable for human consumption because of its toxicity . ' a substance called dnp that is unsuitable for human consumption because of its toxicity . ' she had taken even more of these `` slimming tablets '' than recommended on the pack and had no idea just how dangerous they really were . ' how many of us have ever thought `` if one tablet works , surely it wo n't hurt to take one or two more ? '' ' she went on to explain that her daughter had driven herself to hospital and walked into a & e . as she was still completely lucid and seemed to be ok , she thought there was no danger . however , when the toxicity report came back it became clear how dire her situation was . mrs parry continued : ' the drug was in her system , there was no antidote , and she had taken a lethal dose . ' as ella deteriorated , the staff in a & e did all they could to stabilise her . ' as the drug kicked in and started to make her metabolism soar , they attempted to cool her down , but they were fighting an uphill battle . ' she was literally burning up from within . when she stopped breathing , they put her on a ventilator and carried on fighting to save her . ' when her heart stopped they could n't revive her . ' she added that her daughter never intended to take her own life , she just did n't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the slimming tablets . mrs parry said : ' most of us do n't believe that a slimming tablet could possibly kill us .

' it is such a great sadness that her life ended so soon , and , in many ways , ended before it had really had a chance to begin . ' there were so many things that she dreamed of doing - travelling , having a career and having a family - things that she never got a chance to experience . ' she will be greatly missed by everyone who knew her and it will be all the good memories of her that we will cherish as we go through the difficult weeks and months ahead .
